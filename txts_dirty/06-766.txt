 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in Case 06-766, New York State Board of 

Elections v. Torres.

 Mr. Olson.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON.

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS NEW YORK STATE

 BOARD OF ELECTIONS, ET AL.

 MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 For 10 years, New York relied on political 

party primaries to nominate general election candidates 

for supreme court justice, but that process discouraged 

qualified candidates and spawned unseemly, expensive, 

and potentially corrupting fundraising by judicial 

candidates.

 So the legislature substituted an indirect 

party primary system at which delegates are elected who, 

in turn, select general election candidates at political 

party conventions.

 The Second Circuit concluded that the 

delegate convention statutes enabled political parties 

to exercise too much influence at the expense of the 

insurgent party members or insurgent candidates and

struck those statutes down as facially unconstitutional 

and reinstated the discredited primary process.

 The issue in this case is whether the 

delegate-convention system is facially unconstitutional 

because it allows party leaders to defeat the 

aspirations of party insurgents.

 States have broad, as this case has 

repeatedly held -- broad constitutional latitude to 

prescribe the time, place, and manner of elections, 

particularly elections for State office.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just focus on, if you 

would, Mr. Olson, on the election for the delegates.

 Now, suppose it were shown -- a hypothetical 

case -- that it's extremely difficult to get on that 

ballot. You need, let's say, 2,000 signatures in 30 

days. Would there be a constitutional issue raised by 

that situation?

 MR. OLSON: Well, in the first place, as you 

know, Justice Kennedy, that -- that is not the case 

here. It takes 500 signatures --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: A hypothetical case.

 MR. OLSON: If it were an impossible burden 

to get on the ballot, I still don't think that First 

Amendment associational rights would be involved.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about Kusper, the

Kusper case?

 MR. OLSON: I don't think the Kusper case 

goes that far, Justice Kennedy. I think that, as the 

cases of this Court --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think we have made it 

very clear that if you're going to use a primary system, 

you can't have such burdensome registration requirements 

that the primary system is not, to all intents and 

purposes, to all intents and purposes open to those who 

wish to participate.

 MR. OLSON: I think that the other factor 

that is involved here is that, provided that there is 

reasonable access to the general election, which is 

another factor in this case, then the constitutional 

rights to associate are satisfied.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you think that in 

Kusper, if -- if there was reasonable access to a 

general election, you can structure and stifle the 

primary any way --

MR. OLSON: Well, I think that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm just looking at the 

principle here, and it may be that you'll say that 

there's no burden here, et cetera. But I just want to 

know: Isn't there a constitutional principle that we 

are entitled and we must look at the fairness of the

primary system insofar as participation of the voters?

 MR. OLSON: I think that the case that maybe 

best answers that is the Munro case, in which the State 

of Washington's practice -- and there was a different 

practice of the State of Washington before this Court 

earlier this week. But at that point in time the 

process was that there was an open blanket primary, 

which was not held unconstitutional at that point, where 

the major candidates -- the one and two positions of the 

major candidates of each of the political parties would 

get on the ballot, and then the Socialist Party was 

complaining because it took 1 percent of the votes of 

the primary process to get on the general election 

ballot.

 This Court held that that -- that that was 

not an impossible burden, and that -- the principle from 

that case and the other cases, the American political --

American Party of Texas v. White and so forth, the 

Court's jurisprudence has held that, as long as there is 

reasonable access for a candidate or a political party 

to the general election process, then it does not have 

to be provided in that level in the primary.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it right to 

regard the election of delegates here as a primary 

election?

My understanding, of course, is that that 

simply elects -- it doesn't get you on the ballot. It 

elects delegates who then exercise the choice. Do you 

think our primary election cases are transferable to 

this situation?

 MR. OLSON: Well, I think there are two 

answers to that. Your primary election cases talk in 

terms of, the ones that have been mentioned in the 

briefs here, talk particularly in terms of protection 

under the Equal Protection Clause.

 This is -- it's called a primary, but it's 

an election of delegates by party members that -- and 

then, when those delegates get together, they go to the 

convention. So I'm not sure that the nomenclature makes 

so much difference as this is a process that the State 

has allowed the party to implement to choose its 

leadership. The Court has repeatedly held that there is 

no point in the process --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The State has not allowed 

it. The State has required it, no?

 MR. OLSON: Yes, the State requires it, but 

it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Although if we -- if we 

hold it unconstitutional for the State to require it, I 

suppose it would also be unconstitutional for the State

merely to allow it, wouldn't it? So that this manner of 

selecting judges in any other State, if it has been 

voluntarily adopted by the party, would be 

unconstitutional?

 MR. OLSON: That's the principle that the 

Respondents in the Second Circuit advance. It would 

strike down the conventions, because conventions are, by 

definition, selections of individuals to represent the 

broader constituency at a subsequent --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just to make it clear, is 

it your position that, with reference to this election 

for delegates, the State can make it as burdensome as it 

chooses on those who wish to put themselves forward on 

the ballot as a proposed delegate?

 MR. OLSON: I think, Justice Kennedy, as 

long as the system in the State provides a reasonable 

access to candidates and political parties to the 

election process, that there is not a First Amendment 

right with respect to the primary process or the 

preliminary process, which in this case includes both 

the so-called delegate selection primary --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if it were 

the parties that objected to this and not some 

individual who said, I'm not being given enough voice in 

the party? What if the parties said, we don't want to

select our candidates this way? Is it clear that the 

State could impose it upon them?

 MR. OLSON: It's clear the State has the 

right, and this Court has said so in the American Party 

of Texas v. White, that the State can require either a 

primary election or a convention. The Court 

specifically addressed that. In fact, what the Court 

said: It is too plain for argument that a State may 

insist that intraparty competition be settled by primary 

or convention. That's the holding of that Court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That convention --

conventions can come in all sizes and shapes. The 

argument here is that this system shuts out 

rank-and-file party members and gives the total control 

to the party leaders, and that the preliminary was the 

primary or selection of delegates, but it's really a 

sham because nobody is going to run for that except the 

party faithful, someone picked by the party boss.

 So the argument on the other side is 

that this system, as complicated as it is, reduces to 

the party leaders choose the candidates.

 MR. OLSON: Well, what this Court has said 

in the California Republican Party v. Jones case, a cite 

quoting the Eu case, the Eu case that the Court had 

decided before, is that the political party has the

right to select its leadership, to select its nominating 

process, to select its candidates, and to exclude 

members. So, Justice Ginsburg, the party has the right, 

even arbitrarily, as long as the Fourteenth Amendment is 

not violated in an election context, to exclude members 

of its party.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the State can 

restrict that right if it wants to. The State can 

require the party to select its candidates by -- by 

primary.

 MR. OLSON: By primary or -- or by 

convention.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or by convention.

 MR. OLSON: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But if the State wants to 

do it by smoke -- if the party wants to do it by 

smoke-filled room, the State can say, if it wishes to 

say, you can't do it by smoke-filled room.

 MR. OLSON: It can, Justice Scalia, but the 

State must respect the rights of the political parties 

in determining who their leaders and candidates must be.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that -- but 

that's not the issue here. The State and the party are 

in agreement.

 MR. OLSON: Yes. Yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA: The State is not trying to 

coerce the party into doing something that it doesn't 

want to do.

 MR. OLSON: Yes, I totally agree with you. 

But I'm answering hypothetical questions with respect to 

something else. What this Court has said, that this 

Court vigorously protects the special place the First 

Amendment reserves for the protection by which a party, 

political party, selects a standard-bearer. Selecting a 

candidate is selecting the person that will communicate 

the party's interests --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the party is -- you're 

identifying the party with the party leader because the 

argument comes down to this is not the rank and file 

that's making this election; this is the party leader; 

and the party might like that or the leadership might 

like that, but the rank and file might not, and the 

argument is that they have rights of association, too.

 MR. OLSON: Well, they have rights of 

association, but they have -- they have associated in a 

political party which has elected leadership which makes 

decisions, Justice Ginsburg.

 They do not have a right to belong to the 

Democratic Party or the Republican Party. The rank and 

file, so forth -- the definition of "insurgent," which

is at the other side of the table here, are people that 

are rebelling against the duly elected leadership of the 

political party.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if there is a 

State-mandated primary, I thought it's basic law that 

the State may not place unduly restrictive barriers to 

participation in that primary. I think that's a given, 

it seems to me. Now, tell me if I'm wrong --

MR. OLSON: I may be --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And then we can argue 

about whether the burden is too great here, which it may 

not be.

 MR. OLSON: Let me say, Justice Kennedy, 

that I may be wrong in terms of what this Court's 

decisions stand for with respect to ultimately allowing, 

as far as associational rights are concerned, 

individuals and parties access to the total electorate. 

But even if your premise is correct that there must be 

an open access in a reasonable way to either the -- to 

both the primary and the general election, then this 

process is reasonable. It's not unreasonably difficult 

for a person to participate.

 Let me say -- let me enumerate the ways. An 

individual, a rank-and-file member, can campaign and 

vote for delegates. An individual might become a

delegate himself by -- or herself, by getting 500 names 

on a signature, and that's far below what this Court has 

indicated before was -- was an acceptable level of 

requirement of access to the ballot. An individual can 

attempt to form delegate slates, can attempt to persuade 

the delegates, can -- the individual can form or switch 

parties.

 In this case the Respondent Lopez Torres, 

actually in the 2003 election, became a candidate at the 

general election for supreme court justice of the 

Working Families Party, and she did that without giving 

up her registration and membership in the Democratic 

Party. She was in that election and she lost. 

Finally, and this is even if she hadn't been able to 

secure the nomination of that political party, she could 

run in the general election. There's access to -- it 

takes 3500 to 4,000 signatures to run as an independent 

body in the general election.

 So there is way after way after way for 

individuals in New York to participate in the election 

process.

 So in answer to your question, 

Justice Kennedy, to the extent that your statement of 

the principle with respect to access to both the primary 

and the general election is -- is the law of this Court,

then that access exists here.

 But I come back to the point that political 

parties have the greatest possible latitude -- yes, 

Justice Scalia, that the Court has upheld certain 

restrictions with respect to how the nominee of the 

party gets selected. But the Court has also said that 

when the party is in that process, its powers and rights 

and First Amendment freedoms to elect the 

standard-bearer, to select the standard-bearer, are at 

their apogee, because the person selected as a 

candidate, whether that person might be the most 

favorable person to the rank and file, the duly elected 

leadership of the political party might decide, well, 

that person really isn't qualified to be a supreme court 

justice even --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Have we -- have we imposed 

any such restrictions on our own, as opposed to merely 

upholding restrictions that were imposed by the State? 

That is to say, have we held that the Constitution 

itself imposes certain restrictions?

 MR. OLSON: Except in the context of 

analyzing what State requirements have been?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. I want a case where 

the State did not impose the restriction and it was up 

to us to decide whether the State could do that or not,

but rather the State said the party can do whatever it 

wants, and we have disallowed what the party itself 

chose under no compulsion from the State --

MR. OLSON: Aside --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- on the basis of some 

constitutional principle apart from the Equal Protection 

Clause --

MR. OLSON: Yes. The only cases --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- or the Thirteenth 

amendment.

 MR. OLSON: The only cases that I would 

submit, that I'm aware of, that would answer that would 

be Equal Protection Clause cases, because the --

these -- the political party is a group of people that 

decide to form together because of common beliefs. In 

the -- that is the maximum freedom that we allow for 

associations.

 With all the business about smoke-filled 

rooms and things like that, people have the right to 

decide, make decisions --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think a political 

party could say, you can't vote in our primary unless 

you've been a member of our party for 4 years?

 MR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Kennedy. I -- I 

don't -- in an association --

MR. OLSON: A party would -- there's two 

questions there. If the party wants to have a 4-year 

requirement before you can be a part of that 

association, I can't understand what the First Amendment 

associational right would be.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what about --

MR. OLSON: If the State imposed that, the 

party could say, well, that's unreasonable; we want to 

open -- in fact, the Court decided this by saying that 

the --- the party who wanted to could allow independents 

to vote.

 If I might, Mr. Chief Justice, may I reserve 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Didn't Justice Kennedy 

asked if the Kusper case was correctly decided?

 MR. OLSON: Well, I'm not -- I think I tried 

to answer that the best I could by saying that I think 

the import of the cases, without getting into the 

specifics of that, are that if you have a reasonable 

access by individuals or political parties to the 

electoral process, that satisfies the Constitution.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. ROSSMAN

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS NEW YORK COUNTY

 DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE ET AL.

 MR. ROSSMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I'd like to begin by responding to 

Justice Kennedy's question regarding the election of 

delegates and fairness for voters. There are two 

responses: In this case that I have -- this case, there 

was conceded below that the requirement for delegates of 

getting only 500 signatures was no barrier at all.

 And secondly, I would say that in 

considering that question, Justice Kennedy, the 

important thing is to consider what is the intended role 

that the State gives to the participants in this 

process? And what the role here is that individual 

voters have the opportunity to vote for local delegates 

who are to represent their interests at the convention. 

As Cousins instructs, once they have the opportunity to 

pull a lever for the delegate that shares their values 

and their preferences, their right of suffrage is 

satisfied.

What they do not have, what Respondents and 

what the lower courts would like to have exist but 

doesn't exist and isn't required under the Constitution, 

is the opportunity for rank-and-file voters to vote 

directly for the candidates at the nomination stage, and 

that's the difference between a delegate-based 

convention and a primary.

 If we agree, and I think the Court would 

agree, that there is no right to a primary -- that's 

something, in fact, that's conceded in this case; there 

is no constitutional right to a primary -- then there is 

no State requirement that there be a direct opportunity 

for association between voter and candidate at the 

nomination phase; that it is perfectly appropriate and 

constitutional for that association to be between voter 

and delegate, and the voters then rely on their locally-

elected delegates to advance their interest in the 

convention process.

 That's the difference between a convention 

and a primary. We think it's a critical one here. So 

the cases --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In practice, how many 

people other than the slate selected by the party 

leaders run in New York for this delegate position?

below was that approximately 12 to 13 percent of 

delegate slates are contested. What we suggest is that 

the availability of a contest is the key. It's not the 

frequency of the contest, because there's also evidence 

in the record that for open primaries for civil court, 

which is the closest parallel, that those are only 

contested 28 percent of the time.

 So the fact that an election is not 

contested, that there may be voter apathy out there, 

that there may be party unity that causes people to 

rally behind the parties and their leadership, is not a 

constitutional problem.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The theory of this, I take 

it, is that, just as you said, voters elect convention 

delegates, and those convention delegates choose the 

official nominee, say, of the Democratic Party. So that 

nominee goes on to the final ballot.

 MR. ROSSMAN: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what then of the fact 

that the convention delegates when they meet won't let 

people who would like the position of the judge appear 

before them?

 MR. ROSSMAN: Well, that is not the general 

case in the State of New York.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It's not?

MR. ROSSMAN: But even if it is, the 

important thing is not that individual candidates appear 

to politic before the delegates, it's that delegates 

have the freedom under the statute to vote for whatever 

candidate they like. There's evidence that there's 

legislative intent that, in fact, candidates not appear 

at the convention because it would be unseemly for them 

to do so.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well then, how are the 

delegates to find out the qualifications? In other 

words, if that's the intent of this statute, then you 

have a statute that's designed on the one hand to have 

convention delegates who will choose, and on the other 

hand to prevent the convention delegates from finding 

out the qualifications of the different applicants, in 

which case it would seem to be a statute that would give 

the actual power of selection to the leader or the 

chairman -- I forget the title -- of the Democratic 

Party. And I don't know about the constitutionality of 

that or not. In other words, go ahead.

 MR. ROSSMAN: Let me respond to the most 

difficult part of your question first, which is the 

constitutionality of the party leader selecting a 

candidate we think is not troublesome at all. In fact, 

there are many instances in New York and in other States

where the political leaders, through their structure, do 

pick the candidates, for example in the case of vacancy 

election, which this Court upheld as constitutional in 

the Rodriquez case.

 But the question that I think that you're 

asking is, is there some denial of voter or delegate 

education, and does that pose a constitutional problem? 

We have here a bare statutory framework and the 

statutory framework does not in any way, shape, or form 

preclude the ability of delegates to become educated 

about the candidates. Within that bare statutory 

framework. The parties themselves, through what we 

contend is core associational activity protected by the 

First Amendment, participate in their own way of 

choosing in educating delegates and in putting forth the 

candidacies of judicial -- potential judicial nominees.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose that the 

State can make the judgment that it's more likely that 

the delegates would be informed about the qualifications 

of candidates for judgeship than voters?

 MR. ROSSMAN: In fact, we think that is the 

very judgment that the State has made here. And when, 

as Mr. Olson said, when it went from a primary to a 

convention process, the idea behind it in part was that 

the delegates could be more educated, would be expected

to be more educated than rank-and-file voters would be 

about judges. And the evidence in this case is that 

rank-and-file voters are not educated hardly at all 

about the judge candidates that they select. So we 

think this is clearly a legislative sensible policy 

choice to put the selection process in the hands of 

those who have the motivation and the opportunity to 

become more educated about those that they're selecting.

 Now, one thing that needs to be recalled in 

this process is, of course, it is not merely a State-run 

election. As -- as the Court observed in Jones, it is a 

party affair, too. So there are core First Amendment 

rights of the parties themselves that attach.

 And the question -- I think in response to 

Justice Ginsburg's question about whether there's 

confusion between the party leaders and the parties, it 

is our reading of the Eu, Tashjian and Jones cases that 

the Court has recognized that parties have a structure 

and have the core constitutional right to create their 

own structure, and their leadership can make choices for 

the parties. So they can choose to endorse candidates, 

for example. They can choose to associate or not 

associate with particular individuals. And that's a 

choice that's made here by duly elected leaders of the 

parties.

And if there's a problem with that, the 

remedy for that problem is in the political arena. The 

remedy is for the rank-and-file voters to vote their 

party leaders out when they come up for election if they 

adopt a process that they don't like or they think 

squelches the input of the rank-and-file members.

 So the reason that -- the reason why that's 

not happening here, we believe, could be attributable to 

one of two things. It could be attributable to apathy, 

which the Constitution does not have a prerogative to 

stamp out, or it could be attributable to party unity 

and the fact that leaders are sensitive to who will be 

best to advance the interests of their rank-and-file 

members. But we don't think there's a constitutional 

problem with that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the autonomy of 

the party and, let's say, the leader is the 

justification for this, the party -- how -- how 

autonomous can a party be when it's told, even if you 

want to be more democratic about how you choose your 

candidates, you can't because New York is forcing this 

system on you?

 MR. ROSSMAN: Well, the only system that New 

York is forcing is a bare framework for representative 

democracy. It's a convention. It's no different than

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the parties are not 

protesting in this case, are they?

 MR. ROSSMAN: Absolutely not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If and when that situation 

arises, I suppose we can -- we can decide it. But it's 

not here. The parties are totally happy with this and 

would do it on their own.

 MR. ROSSMAN: We absolutely agree. The 

parties intervened from the outset of this case, both 

major parties, because they share the view that the 

system is better than a primary would be, and they 

believe that their right --

JUSTICE SCALIA: In fact, it is probably 

likely the parties got this system adopted by the New 

York legislature.

 MR. ROSSMAN: Well, however the legislative 

process has unfolded, in 1921, multiple times since, and 

to the present when the legislature filed an amicus 

brief with the Second Circuit, the legislature has 

clearly been in support of this. And we think it's 

within -- it's a core State power, it's a sensible 

legislative choice that they have made. It' ss within 

the contours of American Party of Texas v. White, which 

recognized, as Justice Scalia observed moments ago, that

the State can choose to have primaries or conventions.

 Where the State has chosen to have 

conventions, party rights attach to that. And the one 

thing that the lower court did that we urge the Court to 

consider to be quite inappropriate was to apply strict 

scrutiny to what is routine core party associational 

activity. Leaders developing candidacies, recommending 

candidates, endorsing candidates, and fielding delegates 

who they think are loyal to the interests of the party, 

that doesn't deserve strict scrutiny. At worst, we 

think there's no burden here to the rank-and-file voters 

to force them to participate in the party's own 

convention. But even if there were some burden, at 

worst, we think that there are countervailing rights 

here. And where there are countervailing rights the 

Court should prefer to the legislative expertise here, 

and the expertise -- thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Rossman.

confirmed in great detail by the Second Circuit, found 

that there were severe burdens placed upon insurgents 

and placed upon party members who wished to band 

together to support a candidate.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the burden on a 

single delegate wanting to be on the ballot? I think 

that requires 500 votes, and there was no specific 

finding that that was burden, was there? Or am 

incorrect?

 MR. SCHWARZ: Two --there was no specific 

finding that was a burden, you're correct. I have two 

additional points to make.

 First, if you look at John Dunne's amicus 

brief, John Dunne was a Republican leader in the State 

of New York. He was chairman of the judiciary committee 

for many years in the State Senate. And he on page 19 

of his brief describes how it was impossible even for 

him to get admitted as a delegate, and it wasn't 

worthwhile to try and be a lone gadfly.

 Secondly, the courts analyzed the burden in 

terms of the difficulty of assembling and running a 

slate of delegates, a slate that cut across the various 

assembly districts, and the court found --

JUSTICE ALITO: Assuming that the plaintiffs 

have associational rights at stake here, isn't this a

case where there's a conflict between two associational 

-- two sets of rights of association? You have the 

party hierarchy who wants to, in your own words, fence 

out the insurgents. That's a right not to associate. 

And then you have the insurgents who want to be fenced 

in?

 MR. SCHWARZ: Well, the --

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that different from 

the cases that you rely on?

 MR. SCHWARZ: I -- I think not, Your Honor, 

because I think if you think about the question of do 

the party leaders have the right to stifle the voices of 

ordinary members, one should conclude no, and it's very 

different from your decision in Jones.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But that's charged language: 

They have the right to stifle.

 MR. SCHWARZ: Okay.

 JUSTICE ALITO: The insurgents, do they not 

-- does not the right of association include the right 

not to associate?

 MR. SCHWARZ: I think, Your Honor, the right 

of association does not include the right to use an 

election system imposed by the State which makes it 

impossible. That's where the burden comes from. It's 

because the State has imposed this system on every

party. So I do not think there is a countervailing 

right on the other side.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What are your -- what are 

you best cases for that proposition?

 MR. SCHWARZ: In the -- I would say in the 

first place I'd have to start out by saying there's not 

the case on all fours like this. The -- then I would 

say that's quite clear why that would be, because 

there's no system like this in the United States and 

never has been.

 The -- I guess I would say after that point, 

that the cases -- first, there are principles in your 

cases. There's a principle being worried about the 

effect of State laws serving to entrench power. That's 

a theme that runs through all your cases.

 Secondly, there is in your cases the --

many, many cases that hold what's important is to make a 

realistic assessment of how a statute actually works.

 Now, having said those two points by way 

of -- three points by way of preliminary, first, there's 

nothing on all fours and really you wouldn't expect it, 

then what are cases that I think are -- that bite in our 

favor? Well, there are principles in the cases.

 I would start with Storer and Storer says in 

assessing severe burden what you want to look at is the

-- is the realistic effect of whether people have gotten 

on the ballot. And Storer says if you find that happens 

rarely, while it's not conclusive, it's the -- it's 

indicative that there is a severe burden.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Storer --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that a general 

election case?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a general election 

case, isn't it?

 MR. SCHWARZ: Well, but the principles of 

whether the election, general election cases and the 

primary cases should apply, it seems to me are the same 

principles. The root principles that apply are the same 

ones.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let me ask you 

about that.

 MR. SCHWARZ: Please.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's suppose the 

State doesn't think that direct voter election of judges 

is a good idea, that it thinks there ought to be some 

insulation to avoid the problems of judges campaigning 

and raising money and all that; yet, at the same time 

they want some participation by the voters in the 

process. Is there any way they can achieve that 

objective, to have the nominees actually chosen not by

the voters but by a convention, and yet have some role 

by the voters?

 MR. SCHWARZ: There absolutely is, Your 

Honor. We do not claim here that any convention is 

inappropriate. Conventions are appropriate.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm just asking 

is there a way to have a convention with some role by 

the voters or the party --

MR. SCHWARZ: Yes, Your Honor, as long as 

that convention does not set up severe barriers to 

people competing; and I would say even if you look at 

the Board of Elections' own --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't that 

seem kind of odd, that if a State can have no role for 

voters, it can have a pure convention, that they're 

penalized if they have some role for voters?

 MR. SCHWARZ: I wouldn't put it as being 

penalized, Your Honor. I think it is the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Being found 

unconstitutional is a pretty severe penalty.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. SCHWARZ: But it's what we seek and we 

think the courts below appropriately granted, Your 

Honor. The -- but it's not penalizing the State for 

doing something; it's saying if do you this, and if you

severely burden, as after an extensive fact-finding 

hearing the court held the statutes do, then you have to 

show that there's a compelling justification.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Schwarz -- I'm sorry, 

go ahead.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The, the problem that I 

have in the analogy you are drawing on the application 

of your principle based on the general election cases is 

this: There is concededly -- and you mentioned this 

earlier -- there is concededly no unreasonable barrier 

to somebody who wants to become a delegate. He's got to 

get 500 signature, but that can be done. The burden 

that I understand that your clients are complaining 

about is the, in effect, the burden of influencing the 

ultimate decision-maker to decide to nominate that 

person.

 And that burden is -- is focused on two 

points: number one, the entrenched power of the 

political bosses; and number two, the difficulty --

well, I guess three points -- the difficulty of 

fielding, for a dissident to field a whole slate of 

candidates who in effect, once elected, would make the 

nomination desired; or, three, the capacity of the 

intending or the aspiring candidate to influence the 

delegates directly once they're selected, because the

time is short.

 And those aren't -- those aren't, it seems 

to me, complaints about access to the electoral process. 

They're complaints about the capacity to influence those 

who are elected, who make the ultimate decision. And 

that's the difficulty I have in the analogy that you are 

drawing or the parallel that you are making between the 

direct election cases and your claim here. Could you 

comment on that?

 MR. SCHWARZ: Yeah. I guess I want to make 

two comments. First, it seems to me the principles that 

are in your direct election cases, and also primary 

cases like Kusper and the Panish v. Lubin or Lubin v. 

Panish, where the Court took the language in your 

Williams case about you ought to be worried if there are 

multiple parties competing, clamoring for a place on the 

ballot, and said, well, that should also apply -- this 

Court said that should also apply in a primary context 

where there are multiple people seeking to -- to attain 

a nomination.

 Now, should it matter because here the 

primary or the election -- it's really an election but 

the State happens to call it a primary -- should it 

matter that that is in the preliminary stage, in the 

nomination stage?

I would suggest it should not.

 Now, I think your --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's still the case 

that at the end of the day, the nub of your claim is 

that the intending judicial candidate cannot effectively 

politic, does not have a reasonable chance of getting 

selected; and I don't see that as a -- as a direct 

ballot access claim.

 Let me put the question in another way: 

Your -- your friend on the other side, Mr. Rossman, in 

response to a question, said that if this election of 

the judicial candidate for the party were made directly 

by the political bosses, whatever their titles are, the 

ones who are supposedly in control here, he would not 

see any constitutional objection to that.

 What if New York had a system that provided 

precisely for that? The political bosses, as I 

understand it, get elected every 2 years and the State 

law would provide that those party bosses, whatever 

their title is, would in fact select the candidate. 

Would that be unconstitutional?

 MR. SCHWARZ: I think I would like to draw a 

distinction between the law as I think you've described 

it and a different law that Justice Scalia described. I 

think the law that Justice Scalia described would be

constitutional. If what the State did is to say, you 

the party decide on what to do, I think the State is 

then not putting a thumb on the scale; the State is not 

interfering with the disputes within the party.

 However, on the statute that I think you 

described, Justice Souter, where the State says, we 

decree that for every party the leader shall make the 

decision, I think that would be unconstitutional because 

the State has no business intervening in the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But the party isn't 

objecting.

 MR. SCHWARZ: Well, Your Honor, I think 

that's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: The party -- the party 

likes it.

 MR. SCHWARZ: I'm sure the party likes it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And you are the -- the 

claim here: These people are not, as I understand it, 

bringing a case on behalf of rights of the party. 

They're bringing a case based on a premise of a 

principle of participation, which is theirs.

 And that's why, it seems to me, that the 

hypo that I posed is not significantly different, 

provided the parties aren't objecting, in which we have 

a different case.

But it seems to me that my hypo is not

the question that Mr. Rossman answered.

 MR. SCHWARZ: Well, the -- first, on the 

consent of the party leaders, which is really what we 

have here, of course they are -- they like the system 

because the State system entrenches them.

 And -- and this Court --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the Federal system in 

practice entrenches United States Senators.

 I'm -- I'm not sure that, in terms of 

political participation on the part of an intending or 

an aspiring judge that the system that I suggested in 

the hypo, in which the party bosses select the nominee, 

is for constitutional purposes significantly different 

from the Federal system for -- for picking district 

judges.

 MR. SCHWARZ: Well, because the Federal 

system provides that there shall not be elections. Here 

elections --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. And in my hypo the 

only election is the election for the party boss.

 MR. SCHWARZ: Well, I would still suggest, 

Your Honor, that, as we see the case that would be 

unconstitutional. But our case is much stronger than

that because, in any event, there is here an election 

for delegates.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But isn't your 

argument still that, because there is a limitation on 

the participation of the intending judicial candidate, 

there is ultimately a constitutional problem?

 So let me pose a different question to you, 

and this one is not hypothetical. The nub of your case 

is that the political bosses in effect are controlling 

the process because they tell the delegates who to vote 

for. Does your -- does the intending judicial nominee 

whom you represent have any difficulty in getting to the 

political bosses and saying: I want you to consider me?

 MR. SCHWARZ: Yes. They would not listen to 

her, and they said: We won't listen to you in this 

particular case; we won't listen to you because you 

declined to hire an unqualified person as your law 

clerk.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. They -- for 

political reasons, they're saying: We don't like you. 

There are -- there are a lot of people who go to United 

States Senators, and the United States Senators say: 

Scram; we don't -- we don't like you; your politics 

aren't good enough for us.

 And so I'm not saying that -- that -- on my

hypo the person who lobbies the bosses directly is --is 

claiming a right to success. I think they're claiming a 

right to have a chance to influence the process. And 

why don't they have the chance by going to the boss?

 MR. SCHWARZ: Well, Your Honor, let me try 

two things. First, that never has worked. And it -- it 

has to be -- at least using the Storer analysis of what 

actually happens, the fact that never in the history of 

New York, not in the Republican Party, not in the 

Democratic Party, not in New York City, not in upstate, 

never has someone who was opposed by the party boss been 

able to become a judge.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And I don't know of 

any enemy of a United States -- go ahead.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The person wouldn't be 

opposed if he approached the boss and the boss said: 

Yeah. Boy, I really like you. That person would 

automatically not be a rebel. He'd be part of the 

establishment.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. SCHWARZ: But the -- you know, this 

isn't an issue that divides by ideology. It's --

really, the question here is if you have a statute that 

makes it difficult for the voters to participate, to 

have a voice. That's really the question. And if I

could use something that the Board of Elections' brief 

conceded in both their reply and their opening brief, 

they said a person -- they said that party members who 

wanted to attempt to assemble a slate to try to 

influence the decision at the convention would be "well 

served" -- that's their exact words -- to assemble and 

run a slate. But the district court and the circuit 

court found that it was impossible -- severely 

burdensome, actually impossible -- for that burden to be 

met.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this 

question, Mr. Schwarz. Supposing that the statute did 

not contain the delegate-selection process and instead, 

said: Delegates shall be selected by the county 

chairman in each county and by the organization. Would 

it then be unconstitutional?

 MR. SCHWARZ: If it said delegates will be 

selected --

JUSTICE STEVENS: By party officials.

 MR. SCHWARZ: I'm not sure about that. I'm 

not -- I think that -- I'm not sure. I think it's 

different than Justice Souter's hypothetical.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just saying just 

eliminate this whole folderol about picking delegates 

and say the county chairman shall pick the delegates,

period. I don't see why that would be unconstitutional.

 MR. SCHWARZ: I'm not sure I have a position 

on that one way or the other. What I do say, though, is 

this Court in your Minnesota Republican Party v. White 

decision said it makes -- and, you know, the question of 

whether judges should be elected or appointed is a 

controversial question. But this Court in that decision 

said that if you're going to have an election -- and 

here we have elections for delegates -- if you're going 

to have an election, you shouldn't structure that 

election in a way that makes it in that case extremely 

difficult or impossible or forbidden --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Schwarz, you're 

talking about the election of the judge or the election 

of the delegate? I think you're mixing two oranges and 

apples there.

 MR. SCHWARZ: Well, the -- I do believe that 

the election of the delegates raises the constitutional 

questions about has the State put its thumb on the 

scale, has the State done something that severely 

burdens the voters.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It -- the evidence shows 

the thumb on the scale is just as strong as if the party 

chairman picked the delegates. And, therefore, it seems 

to me, it presents the question of whether it would be

unconstitutional to enact a statute that allows the 

party chairman to pick the delegates.

 MR. SCHWARZ: I'm not sure, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if you're not sure, 

it's difficult --

JuSTICE KENNEDY: If I could interrupt, 

Justice Breyer, for just a moment. But in the Minnesota 

case the thumb on the scale was to deprive the 

constituents of a First Amendment right. Smith v. 

Allwright, it was a right not to be discriminated 

against race. Here what we're asking is: What is the 

substantive right?

 MR. SCHWARZ: Well, I think here it is the 

right not to be burdened, severely burdened, in an 

election. And that just runs through all your cases --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but what you are 

calling -- and correct me if I am wrong. Maybe I 

misunderstand this. I think what you are calling the 

severe burden is the difficulty of assembling a whole 

slate that can control the meeting or have a majority in 

the ultimate meeting of that delegate, of those 

delegates, and therefore actually select the candidate 

who wants to put the slate together. And it's control 

over result rather than the capacity of any individual 

to get elected a delegate which I think you are

objecting to. Am I wrong?

 MR. SCHWARZ: We have never said that 

there's a right to win. We have only said there's a 

right to meaningfully participate.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but when you say 

"meaningfully participate" you talk about putting -- and 

candidly talk about putting -- a slate of delegates 

together.

 If I put a slate of delegates together, it 

is because once those delegates are selected they're 

going to support me; and that's why it -- I think your 

real argument is not that somebody has difficulty 

becoming a candidate for a delegate or even getting 

elected one. The difficulty that you're claiming is 

that it's hard for the intending judicial candidate to 

assemble a large enough group of people to give that 

candidate success once the delegates are elected. It's 

a success argument that you are making, not an access 

argument.

 MR. SCHWARZ: No. It's a compete argument, 

not an access argument. And I do think the Constitution 

should be read to say that if the State passes laws that 

make it very hard for voters to band together or for 

insurgent candidates to compete, then -- and it is a 

severe burden, they have to justify it. And, by the

way, they haven't sought in their papers to justify it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could a State decide it 

doesn't want candidates to have any part in this 

delegate-selection process? It thinks it's unseemly to 

have would-be judges engage in that kind of activity. 

So it structures the system that says that they choose 

delegates for a convention, but we don't want those 

delegates to be the delegates of any particular 

candidate. We want to insulate this process from 

would-be candidate influence. Would that be 

unconstitutional?

 MR. SCHWARZ: The problem is that in the 

real world the statutes work to entrench the power of 

the party leaders and to prevent voters from, to use the 

Board of Elections' reply brief, I think, on page 5, to 

use -- or 17, to use -- the voters are not able to band 

together to try and influence the results at the 

conventions.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course not. You're 

really arguing against the whole purpose this scheme, 

which is not to have judges popularly elected. And 

you're saying no, we want them popularly elected. The 

purpose of the scheme is to -- is to have the people 

elect delegates and have delegates use their good 

judgments as to who -- as to who the best judge would

be. But you say, no, we want the people to have an 

input. I mean, it's contrary to the whole purpose of 

the scheme. Of course it works the way you say it does. 

It is designed to work that way. It's a basic judgment 

not to have judges popularly elected, and your objection 

amounts to saying no, judges ought to be popularly 

elected.

 MR. SCHWARZ: We -- we have no problem with 

the convention, but we don't think that the -- either 

the insurgent candidate or the band of voters who wish 

to support that person should be, by the State, fenced 

out, severely burdened from attempting to --

I take it, if they don't prevail? For example --

MR. SCHWARZ: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the other side 

says that your argument is -- is implicated whenever a 

convention leads to a different nominee than the 

primary.

 MR. SCHWARZ: No, that's -- that's not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't think 

there's anything wrong with the convention deciding that 

the nominee is going to be someone other than the person 

who would prevail in the primary election.

fence them out to that extent?

 MR. SCHWARZ: If you want -- if we want to 

call that fencing. I don't call that fencing. That's 

the -- if the convention is one that is put together 

without the State burdening the ability for people to 

get involved --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it, in 

evaluating the burden, we should look at how difficult 

it is for someone to be elected a delegate.

 MR. SCHWARZ: I think you should also look 

at the -- since the party leaders run slates and they 

have no difficulty in running slates because -- for 

various reasons that the courts found, I think you 

should look at the question of slates as well as 

individual delegates. And in considering individual 

delegates, I do think that Mr. Dunne's amicus brief 

which describes, on his page 19, indicates that, you 

know, it's -- it's a little unrealistic to think that 

anybody other than --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is that

was designed -- their words, their admission -- to 

entrench the power of the party leaders, I think that 

gives us a problem.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? I mean I don't see 

how you avoid answering Justice Stevens's hypothetical? 

The reason I think you have to answer it is because the 

New York system is the system he described in the 

hypothetical, with a safety valve.

 MR. SCHWARZ: The safety valve being?

 JUSTICE BREYER: The safety valve being that 

the party leaders cannot just choose anybody. I mean, 

if it looks they're going to choose something really 

nutty, then there will be opposition to these delegates 

and something will happen.

 MR. SCHWARZ: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: So they have leeway, but 

you can't go too far.

 MR. SCHWARZ: The record, Your Honor, and 

this is an extensive record, shows that the party 

leaders can choose and do choose people who are, to use 

your word, who are --

JUSTICE BREYER: You don't like that. 

That's why I say you have to answer it. If you feel 

that that's so terrible, then you say no, the 

Constitution forbids that, though you'd have to explain,

wouldn't you, why, with all its faults, that is not 

better in the judgment of New York than a system where 

people raise $4 million from the lawyers in order to run 

for office?

 MR. SCHWARZ: We -- no, we -- we have not 

said that there needs to be a primary. We haven't said 

that. And sometimes our opponents leave the impression 

that we have said that. We haven't said that.

 You know, there are -- get rid of the 

leaders --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the -- that's the 

remedy that, the temporary remedy, that you sought was 

-- at the bottom line, the court's order was, until New 

York reacts to this decision, the candidates will be 

chosen by primary.

 MR. SCHWARZ: Yes, the -- but the judge, 

Your Honor -- the judge did two things in imposing that 

remedy, three or four things actually:

 He said, first, I'm not going to 

micromanage. I think the statutes are unconstitutional. 

I'm not going to get into all the details of fixing it 

because the Legislature should do that and the Federal 

courts shouldn't do that.

 Second, he relied on the fact that the 

fall-back position in the State statutes is there is a

primary if there is no other system in place.

 But, third and most important, he stayed his 

decision to give the Legislature time to address the 

question, and they were well on their way to addressing 

it when this Court gave us the opportunity to be here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree it's 

not realistic that one way they would address it is by 

having an entirely appointed system?

 MR. SCHWARZ: No, they -- they're entitled 

to do that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know they are 

entitled to it.

 MR. SCHWARZ: Well, the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As a practical 

matter, is that a realistic option in New York?

 MR. SCHWARZ: If you look at the amicus 

briefs filed in our favor, the State bar, the City bar, 

the Fund for the Modern Courts, the City of New York all 

filed a brief in which they say, we think the right 

solution is to have an appointive system, and they're 

working to try to have that happen. And the governor 

has put forward a bill for an appointive system. But, 

they say --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sure he 

has. I mean that's in his interest.

 MR. SCHWARZ: No, not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought I read a 

representation somewhere in the briefs that it's 

unrealistic to expect that New York would move to an 

entirely appointive system. So that the options, if 

you're successful, the options will either be direct 

election of judges or a pure convention with no role for 

the voters at all.

 MR. SCHWARZ: No, it could be a role for the 

voters that does not burden them in the way this statute 

burdens them.

 And the -- that brief by the State bar and 

the Bar of the Association of the City of New York and 

the other groups who are strongly in favor of an 

appointive system, say to this Court, this is the worst 

of all worlds. And it -- this system, as also the 

amicus brief from the former judges who were responsible 

for appellate judges responsible for administering the 

New York State system, says that this system has 

undermined judicial independence and undermined 

confidence in the courts.

 And that is -- you know -- that is clearly 

correct --

think it was, in the Feerick Report that said, the worst 

thing in the world would be to return us to the primary 

system this system was intended to replace.

 MR. SCHWARZ: Yes, the -- actually the 

Feerick report, which found that the party leaders all 

over State however have always made the picks, they 

voiced a favoring amending the law. They -- they think 

the law needs to be amended.

 And Chief Judge Kaye, in her remarks after 

the decisions came down and after the Feerick Commission 

report came out, said the problems that had been 

revealed in this case are pervasive both systemically 

and geographically.

 The Feerick Commission's view is that, 

unless there's public financing, in which case they'd 

favor some more involvement by the voters, is simply 

amend the portions of the law that make it so burdensome 

on competitors, on voters.

 We're -- we're neutral. We just say this 

law is unconstitutional. And how it should be amended 

is up to the Legislature, but that it should be amended 

is -- there's a powerful case and, you know, I don't 

know where I am on the time here, but I commend to you

difference.

Constitution, and, indeed, it's not very often that you

Legal Foundation and the ACLU coming in, as they have 

come in, to assert that this is an unconstitutional 

statute.

Party --

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS NEW YORK STATE

 BOARD OF ELECTIONS ET AL.

 MR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 The Second Circuit reinstalled what the New 

York Legislature found to be a bad system, that it 

discouraged qualified candidates and it encouraged this 

unfortunate, unseemly race for money.

 The Respondents just said that that is not 

what they were interested in doing, but their prayer for 

their relief, on page 35 of their complaint, calls for a 

direct primary election for the Supreme Court.

 With respect to the Kusper case, 

Justice Kennedy, I gave that a little bit more thought. 

That -- that case focused on the fact that the statute 

was inhibiting the rights of an individual who wanted to 

participate in a way that the party wanted that 

individual to participate. That long period of time 

prevented both the individual and the association from 

associating together, which is why --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You say the State, your 

mean the State statute?

MR. OLSON: Yes. But -- and to the extent 

that it was -- it was -- part of that is answered by 

your Clingman case which just came relatively recently, 

where the party wanted independents to vote in the 

primary and the Supreme Court -- this Court said that 

the State had to let that happen. With respect to time 

periods between when you had to identify yourself as a 

party member this court held in the Rosario case that a 

certain length of time is appropriate under the system.

 With respect to Mr. Dunne, we've heard about 

him. He may have had a desire to be a delegate but he 

never tried to get the 500 signatures. It says that 

right on his -- on page 19 of his brief -- the brief 

that my colleague was quoting.

 With respect to the questions that I think 

both Justice Stevens and Justice Souter were asking, 

could the State lodge the candidate selection or the 

delegate selection process in the party leaders, I can't 

conceive of how that would be unconstitutional.

 If the parties wanted to select the 

delegates or select the candidates to be their standard 

bearers, that seems to me to be perfectly within the 

right of an association to do; and would be perfectly 

appropriate, provided that there was an access for 

independents and --

 MR. OLSON: No. But I think those 

hypothetical questions are could the State vest that 

authority.

 Finally I think it's important to say -- oh, 

one more preliminary point. It is competitive in New 

York. It may not be perfectly competitive, as is the 

case of 90 percent of the congressional districts in 

this country, which are said not to be competitive. But 

in New York, six sitting judges testified in -- in -- in 

the lower court that they successfully lobbied delegates 

to, you know, to be candidates. So that happens.

 Between 1900 and 2002, this is appendix 130, 

nearly one fourth of the general elections in New York 

were competitive.

 Lopez Torres, the Respondent, received 25 

votes at the 2002 judicial selection convention, and 

many of the districts in New York are not dominated by a 

single party.

statute that simply creates a delegate election and it 

then creates a convention. Neither of those provisions 

can possibly be constitutional, and so what the 

Respondents are complaining about is what party bosses 

do.

 But on page 38 of their brief, they state 

categorically that the constitutional offense is not the 

fact that party leaders act as one would expect in 

choosing nominees. 

In other words, they act -- party leaders act like party 

leaders and exercise their influence. They're not 

saying that that's unconstitutional. What they're 

saying is that a statute that allows party leaders to be 

party leaders, to be constitutional, to act in ways 

which are not only permissible under the Constitution as 

they knowledge, but constitutionally protected, is 

somehow constitutional. That simply is not consistent 

with any of this Court's jurisprudence, which says that 

political parties must have the maximum opportunity to 

select their leadership. 

Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr. Olson.

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
