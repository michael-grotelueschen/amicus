 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 07-608, United States v. Hayes.

 Ms. Saharsky.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Respondent's conviction for battering his 

wife is a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence 

primarily for two reasons: First, the statutory text is 

most naturally read that way. Second, a contrary 

reading would defeat Congress's purposes. 

Nine courts of appeals have determined that the text 

does not require a domestic relationship to be an 

element to the predicate offense. That's because the 

statute's text uses only one element, using the singular 

word "element," which relates to mode of aggression. It 

then introduces a new concept related to domestic 

relationship, using a comma and the word "committed." 

The word "committed" naturally modifies the word 

"offense." In common usage, a person commits an 

offense; he doesn't commit a use or attempted use of 

physical force.

Under Respondent's reading of the statute, when it was 

enacted it would have become immediately a dead letter 

in two-thirds of the States, and it wouldn't have any 

application to the Federal Government. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, Respondent says that 

may be because a lot of people in Congress wanted it to 

be a dead letter. They would have wanted the whole 

thing to be a dead letter. There are a lot of people 

who didn't like this statute because it was a gun 

control statute.

 MS. SAHARSKY: But Congress did act this 

statute, and this Court presumes two things: First --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if it's a compromise 

with the people who wanted no statute at all and you 

come out with a statute that covers one-third of the 

States anyway, I mean that's, you know -- that's the 

deal.

 MS. SAHARSKY: There was a compromise made, 

but it wasn't with respect to whether there needed to be 

a domestic relationship element. It was with respect to 

how violent the offense had to be.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How do we know -- how do we 

know that?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, if you look at the 

statute's drafting history, there were two versions

considered. One used the term "crime of violence" to 

discuss how violent the statute had to be, and then the 

second substituted in the new language: "...has as an 

element the use or attempted use of physical force or 

threatened use of a deadly weapon."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it also substituted 

this structure that we are -- that we are discussing 

today. Didn't that come in at the same time?

 MS. SAHARSKY: The --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, why -- why say it's 

only the former provision that was the compromise and 

not the addition of this later language?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Both the original structure 

and the statute as enacted had the same structure in 

that they had a "committed by" clause that modified the 

word "offense."

 Now, it's true that the use -- "has as an 

element language" that came in added some additional 

structure in terms of the Romanette (i) and the 

Romanette (ii), but that all came in because there was a 

discussion about how violent the offense had to be, both 

-- in the original statute that was considered, you have 

an offense committed by a certain person, an offense of 

a certain type committed by a certain person, and in the 

statute that was enacted you have an offense of a

certain type committed by a certain person. Now, 

Congress put more detail in, in terms of what that 

certain type of offense is. This has as an "element" 

language, but it just didn't go to domestic 

relationship.

 And to get back to one of the earlier points 

in your question, you know, this Court presumes when 

Congress passes a statute two things are true: First, 

it knows the legal backdrop on which it enacts the law; 

and second, that it's presumed that its law is going to 

have effect. And that should be especially true here 

where Congress was dealing with a serious nationwide 

problem of domestic violence using firearms. Congress 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The suggestion was that 

Congress may have wanted to give an incentive to States 

to have special domestic violence statutes instead of 

punishing domestic abusers under a generic battery 

statute.

 MS. SAHARSKY: I don't think that makes 

sense for two reasons: First, because when Congress 

wants to do that, it uses its spending power to give the 

States incentives to do things like that, and it did 

that in the VAWA enactment in 1994 and in VAWA 

re-authorization in 2005.

And, second, because if you believe what 

Respondents suggest, you would have to think that a 

Congress that was very concerned about the powder keg 

situation of a domestic offender with a gun would want 

to exempt domestic offenders who have proven that they 

are willing to hurt family members in two-thirds of the 

States, a Congress that was presumed -- that was 

concerned with the problem of domestic violence would 

enact a statute that would apply so infrequently, to at 

most these 17 States, and wouldn't apply at all to 

Federal offenses, making that "misdemeanor under Federal 

law" language superfluous.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I 

understand your objection to the reading that your 

friend would have us adopt, but you have the same sort 

of problem. I mean, you've got a -- if it reads the way 

you would have it, then the word "that" after "an 

offense that" doesn't quite work, and have you to add 

"is" before "is committed," if you're going to keep the 

"that." So it seems to me that this doesn't work 

grammatically either way.

 MS. SAHARSKY: I don't think that that's 

right, with respect, Your Honor, because you have an 

offense that is of a certain character committed by a 

certain person.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you've changed 

the word. You read it as if it says "an offense that 

committed." So either the "that" is out or you've got 

to add the word "is."

 MS. SAHARSKY: I think that the word 

"offense" is twice modified. There is an offense that 

is of a certain character and there is an offense 

committed by a certain --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. You use the 

word "that" in the first example, but you skip the word 

"that" in the second. "That" appears in the line and 

then comes (i) and (ii). In other words, that modifies 

both of them, and you're reading it that it's an offense 

committed, and yet under the statute it has to be an 

"offense that committed." So you've either got to leave 

"that" out the second time but not the first or you've 

got to add the word "is" as it appears in (i).

 MS. SAHARSKY: What I'm suggesting, Your 

Honor, is that the "that" refers to everything that is 

in Romanette (i) and (ii) up to the break with 

"committed by." So that it is an offense that is a 

misdemeanor and has as an element "committed by." You 

know, these -- these two different clauses both modify 

"offense," just as a grammatical matter, not looking at 

this Romanette (i) and (ii), but just looking at that

sentence.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Romanette?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Oh, little Roman numeral.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I've never heard 

that before. That's -- Romanette.

 (Laughter.)

 MS. SAHARSKY: If you just look at this as a 

sentence, you have "an offense that is a misdemeanor and 

has as an element committed by." Now, that "committed 

by" clause, it could have come after "offense" or it 

could be in the place where it is now. There are just 

these two different ways that offenses qualify.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't. I mean, you 

have the "that," and the "that" applies to both (i) and 

(ii), and this is part of (ii). I think you've got to 

either say "that committed" or -- or put in an "is" --

"that is committed." It just doesn't parse, and that 

lack of parsing is much worse than the one that you --

you point to in the other side's reading. Yes, it's not 

usual to talk about committing a use of force, but it 

happens sometimes. It's -- it's not the most elegant 

language, but there are many examples of such usage that 

have been brought forth by the other side and by some of 

the amici. So they have something that -- it's not 

elegant, but people have spoken that way. Nobody speaks

the way you want us to speak: "An offense that 

committed by a person or an offense that" -- "committed 

by a current or former..." Nobody talks that way.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Two responses.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Nobody.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Two responses, Your Honor. 

First, the "committed by" language refers back to 

"offense" and the "that" is just part of this -- this 

first clause, but -- and we believe that the 

Government's reading is the most logical reading. And 

think of it this way: You know, Respondent agrees that 

if there were a hard return before the "committed by" 

language, that it's clear -- that it would be more clear 

that the Government's reading is correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't agree with that. 

You'd still have the "that" up above. You would have to 

have a hard return and take out the "that" or -- or that 

(A) is a misdemeanor, "has as an element" and then a 

hard return, and you have to add "and is committed." 

You still have to add language besides the hard return.

 MS. SAHARSKY: With respect, Your Honor, we 

think this can be read as all one sentence. But just to 

make my second point, which is: I think that it would 

do much more violence, Respondent's reading of the 

statute, than you suggest because you're talking about

treating the singular word "element" as plural. You're 

talking about ignoring the comma that separates the "has 

as an element" section from the "committed by" section, 

and then you're talking about taking what even the 

linguists who filed a brief in this case essentially in 

support of Respondents say is a very weird usage of 

"committed."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you -- I'm 

sorry. I'm not following why "element" is singular. 

The argument on the other side, I understood, is that 

the element is the use of physical force committed by a 

current or former spouse. So "element" is still 

singular. I -- maybe I'm missing something. What 

change would you have to make to the word "element" to 

adopt their reading?

 MS. SAHARSKY: We think that you'd say --

you'd have to say "has as its elements" to suggest that 

you would take two very diverse concepts and make them 

both required elements of the underlying offense.

 There are two concepts here: One is how 

violent the offense has to be, and then there's the 

second concept, which is a class of defendants, and 

that's a very different concept. But if you just see 

the singular "element," "has as an element," and then 

you see, oh, okay, it has to be violent.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I thought 

the whole point of this was to get at violence committed 

by a family member, and if that's the critical element, 

you don't have to have two different elements, 

"violence" and then "committed." It's violence 

committed by a family member.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, with respect, Your 

Honor, we think that because Congress broke these up 

into these two different clauses -- one that relates to 

violence and then a separate clause that's introduced by 

"committed by" where "committed" naturally modifies 

"offense" -- that it was treating -- that these were two 

separate requirements. And you're right that Congress 

was trying to get at the problem of violent domestic 

offense, and if it was doing that it would make no sense 

at all for Congress to -- to have enacted a statute that 

would such extremely limited application. And, of 

course, Respondent's reading would make the "is a 

misdemeanor under Federal law" superfluous.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If we think that 

there are two awkward readings, yours and your friend's, 

and both of them require surgery, don't we resolve that 

under the rule of lenity?

 MS. SAHARSKY: No. The rule of lenity says 

that there needs to be a grievous ambiguity after this

Court seizes aid -- any aid which can be derived from 

the tools of statutory interpretation. So even though 

we think that the text here is most naturally read in 

the Government's way, every other indicia of meaning 

here points in favor of the Government's interpretation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what -- what's 

been the underlying rationale for the rule of lenity, 

which is a rule I think we should apply with great 

caution? But if we think -- what's the reason for the 

rule of lenity?

 MS. SAHARSKY: I think one of the -- the 

main concerns is providing fair notice of what's 

illegal.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Fair notice. It -- it --

it seems to me that if I were counsel practicing 

criminal law in the private sector, and I negotiated a 

plea for simple assault, but there was a spouse that was 

involved, and then I walked down the courthouse step 

with my clients, said we got a good deal, and 

incidentally, all guns in your house must immediately be 

surrendered to other people, you must take them all out, 

you may never hunt, you may never possess a gun.

 And under your view, if I don't say that I'm 

guilty of, it seems to me, serious malpractice. I just 

don't see that there is notice to the legal profession.

MS. SAHARSKY: Well certainly, Your Honor, 

we think that the statutory text is clear, and that's 

because people are presumed to know the law. Certainly 

a person who has beaten his wife knows that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the rule --

MS. SAHARSKY: -- the assault he was 

convicted of is one against his wife.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. Where the context is, 

we are asking why the rule of lenity and the rule of 

lenity is to ensure notice. And it seems to me this is 

a classic case where there has to be notice. You could 

come back and say that even if the statute had been 

written as to apply specifically to domestic crimes, a 

lot of attorneys wouldn't have had notice on it when it 

was an omnibus budget bill added at the last minute.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Your Honor, it was at the 

time that this statute was enacted the case that very 

few States had statutes with a domestic relationship 

requirement, only 17. And to be clear, in those 17 

States those all covered more domestic relationships 

than the Federal statute. They covered things like 

dating relationships, violence involving grandparents, 

etcetera. So that even from the face of your State 

conviction, you wouldn't be able to just match it right 

up with this Federal offense. And the fact that those

17 States -- A, that there was such a small number; and 

B, that those States cover a different range of domestic 

offenses --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There was a small, a 

small number. Were they populous States?

 MS. SAHARSKY: I think it was a range of 

States. I don't think I could say it was all the most 

populous or all the least populous States.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: California, New 

York?

 MS. SAHARSKY: You know, I'd have to look at 

the list. I think that California came in later -- no, 

California did have one statute; New York did not.

 But you know, one thing that's worth 

noticing in this case is that you know, the Senator, 

Senator Lautenberg, who was the sponsor of this 

legislation, was from New Jersey; and other Respondent's 

reading of this statute it wouldn't have even applied to 

offenses committed in New Jersey. And that seems like 

an odd thing to believe. And of course, it wouldn't 

have applied to Federal offenses despite the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- may I ask, to 

make sure I understand the alternate reading. Is it 

your view that the statute does mean the same as if,

a parenthetical (iii), closed paren, "is committed by"? 

If -- now there is the element of "attempted use of 

force" is one, is the second requirement; and the third 

requirement is that it be committed by a current or 

former spouse.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. I think --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So your -- your reading --

I'm just following up on the Chief Justice's question --

requires us to assume that Congress really intended 

there to be a triple "i" as well as a double "i", and 

the triple "i" would have begun with the verb "is."

 MS. SAHARSKY: I think that that's one way 

of doing it, but I don't think that you have to do that, 

because if you look at the structure of this sentence --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But it is true, is it not, 

that if you did do it that way, it would have been a lot 

clearer than it is now?

 MS. SAHARSKY: There are ways that Congress 

could have made its manifest intent even more clear. It 

could have added that Romanette (iii); it could put a 

hard return before "committed by." But if you look at 

the effect that the statute would have, if you read it 

Respondent's way, I don't think that we can reasonably 

expect that Congress -- a Congress that wanted to get at 

the serious nationwide problem of domestic violence

using firearms, would have wanted to enact a statute 

that would have such limited effect.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I want to follow up on 

Justice Kennedy's inquiry about the rule of lenity. 

Don't you think the rule of lenity is particularly 

important when you're dealing with conduct that is not 

malum in se? I mean, to say that, well, we are not 

going to apply the rule of lenity to a statute that 

posits an increased sentence for kneecapping or for some 

violent conduct, the person knows he shouldn't be doing 

that stuff anyway. But this imposes a -- a -- a penalty 

for conduct that no one would think is unlawful.

 This fellow is -- wasn't it his father's gun 

he was taking to sell at a gun show or something?

 MS. SAHARSKY: There were five firearms. 

There was one found in his home, three that he 

transferred and one that he sold.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he could have ten, 

couldn't he?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, we would hope that he 

wouldn't in this situation. But --

language that you say makes his owning of a firearm 

unlawful, it wouldn't be unlawful at all, would it? He 

would have no reason to think he couldn't have a 

firearm.

 MS. SAHARSKY: I think that a person who has 

been committed of a violent offense should be on notice 

that their procession of firearms --

 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: A misdemeanor -- a 

misdemeanor offense. And -- and -- and he should 

suspect that because he committed a misdemeanor, he 

cannot have a firearm?

 MS. SAHARSKY: When --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think anybody would 

assume that. Indeed, there are some who assume that 

you -- you cannot prevent the owning of a firearm for a 

mere misdemeanor, as opposed to a felony.

 MS. SAHARSKY: I understand that concern. 

We are not talking about mere misdemeanors here. We are 

talking about a specific category of violent 

misdemeanors, Section 929(g)(9); specifically --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Make it clear.

 Make it clear, so that when -- when his 

lawyer pleads to the offense, he doesn't have to read in

a little (iii) where there is not a little (iii).  And 

he -- well, you did not plead guilty or you are not 

accused of the offense of using violence against a 

family member. You're just -- just accused of -- of 

using violence, a misdemeanor.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Two thoughts on that, Your 

Honor. The first is, you know, at the time that this 

statute was enacted almost all of the States except for 

this small number prosecuted offenses that were domestic 

disturbance offenses like the one in this case under 

general assault and battery statutes, and even the 17 

States that have those with the domestic relations, 

offenses with the domestic relationship requirement, 

still prosecute them routinely as assault and battery 

under those general statutes.

 So I think a person -- A, an attorney who 

handles those kind of cases would have knowledge of that 

law; and B, a person who has committed a serious violent 

offense like Respondent's previous offense in this case 

should be on notice that his possession of firearms 

might be regulated.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- a serious violent 

offense. Are there -- is there felony assault and 

battery?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA: And this was misdemeanor 

assault and battery, wasn't it?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes, that's right. I mean, I 

really --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's not that serious an 

offense. That's why we call it a misdemeanor.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, I mean, certainly the 

offense is this particular case was serious. The 

charging document reflects that Respondent hit his wife 

all around the face until it swelled out, kicked her all 

around her body, kicked here in the ribs --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Then he should have been 

charged with a felony, but he wasn't. He was charged 

with a misdemeanor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't the -- wasn't the 

statute responding to just that problem, that domestic 

abuse tended to be charged as misdemeanors rather than 

felonies? And it was that fact that the Senator was 

responding to when he included misdemeanor. The whole 

purpose of this was to make a misdemeanor battery count 

for the statute's purpose.

 MS. SAHARSKY: That's exactly right, Justice 

Ginsburg. All of the discussion of this in Congress 

said we need to have a zero tolerance towards people --

zero tolerance policy towards people who are -- have

proven that they are willing to commit violent acts 

against family members; and we already have a statute 

that prohibits felons from possessing firearms, but we 

know that sometimes these domestic offenses get charged 

as misdemeanors. And Senator Lautenberg specifically 

said in the legislative record they are often charged as 

offenses like assault and battery, and we need to get at 

these offenses because these people should not have 

firearms. They should not put their families in that 

type of powder keg situation, and they -- we should not 

be putting police in that type of situation, where 

police who respond to a domestic disturbance call like 

the 911 call in this case are put in a dangerous 

situation with a person -- an emotionally charged 

situation -- who would have a firearm.

 One other point that I wanted to make with 

respect to your question, Justice Scalia -- and this is 

not with respect to how this case should be resolved, 

but just as a practical matter -- that the VAWA 2005 

amendments do require States, for a condition of their 

grant funding, to have a judicial policy that gives 

notice for offenses like assault and battery that a 

person would not be able to possess a firearm.

 And the reason that they are doing that is 

not because, you know, as a constitutional matter we

think that they need to, but because they really --

Congress just really wants to keep firearms away from 

people who have shown that they are willing to hurt 

family members in this way.

 Now, I talked a little bit in the beginning 

of argument about how really every -- every indicia of 

meaning in this case -- and we do look to -- to each of 

those different interpretive tools before we would 

invoke the rule of lenity -- points in favor of the 

Government's construction. First of all, you've got the 

text, and I think we've -- we've covered those 

arguments. But just as a practical matter, this statute 

would have an extremely limited effect if it didn't --

if it were interpreted as Respondent suggests.

 The language with respect to Federal 

misdemeanors would be superfluous because the way that 

Federal offenses like domestic assaults on Army bases 

are charged is under a general Federal assault statute. 

There isn't one that's specific to domestic violence. 

So Congress would have put this "misdemeanor under 

Federal law" language in there, and it -- it would have 

immediately had no effect either. You know, the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it seems there 

is no Federal misdemeanor that covers this particular 

type of assault, in other words?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

 MS. SAHARSKY: But it doesn't have a 

domestic relationship requirement, and that's the 

problem. You know, we also look to the drafting history 

just a bit, and I -- I think that, you know, every 

indicia -- every indication in the drafting history, 

both if you compare the first version of the bill with 

the statute that was enacted and the discussion relating 

to it, shows that this language "has as an element," 

which really only intended to get at how violent an 

offense had to be, it -- it was never intended to get at 

any kind of domestic relationship requirement. And, of 

course, the -- the sponsor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think -- I think that 

people are governed by the law that is passed, not by 

the law that Congress intended to pass.

 MS. SAHARSKY: That's exactly right, Justice 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, really, if a lawyer 

reading this would not think that it applied, I don't 

care what Congress intended. If -- if the law doesn't 

say that, the person is not governed by it. You think a 

person could be governed by it despite the fact that it

doesn't say that because Congress intended it?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Of course not, Justice 

Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course.

 MS. SAHARSKY: We look to the text first, 

but we also look to other indicia -- many of us also 

look to other indicia of Congress's intent. And some of 

those indicia include things like a comparison of the 

drafting history and Senator Lautenberg's statement, 

which is directly on point here, which says that 

offenses like assault and battery would be covered. 

This is a -- a powerful tool.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how does that 

relate to the rule of lenity? I suppose, to get back to 

Justice Kennedy's point, you're saying that the lawyer 

would not only be obligated to read this, but in 

advising his client would be obligated to go back and 

read the drafting history and the legislative history. 

Do we really use those types of materials to trump the 

-- the rule of lenity?

 MS. SAHARSKY: This Court has in -- in 

multiple cases looked to the fact that the statute, for 

example, would have such a narrow, limited purpose, in 

addition to the statute's text, to say, you know, we 

can't believe Congress would expect that purpose --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the lawyer 

advising his client in the typical assault case is 

supposed to know at the time that only 17 States had 

this type of provision?

 MS. SAHARSKY: I think it was well known at 

the time that these offenses, even in the 17 States that 

had the domestic relationship element, were commonly 

prosecuted as assault and battery offenses. And this 

Court has -- for example, let's consider the Taylor 

case, where this Court was considering the example of 

burglary and trying to define: Should we pick this 

narrow, common-law definition of "burglary," or a more 

expansive definition of "burglary"?

 And, aside from looking at the legislative 

history, there is a separate section of the Court's 

opinion where you said: Look, if we took this narrow, 

common law definition of "burglary," it would apply 

basically nowhere and we just can't think that Congress 

intended that.

 And you didn't go right to the rule of 

lenity there. You looked at, for example, how that 

frustration of congressional purpose would occur and the 

problem that that would cause.

 If there are no further questions, I'd like 

to reserve the remainder of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TROY N. GIATRAS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. GIATRAS: Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court:

 The fundamental flaw in the Government's 

argument is that it describes a statute that Congress 

considered but did not pass. In the statute's final 

version Congress defined the "misdemeanor crime of 

domestic violence" to require that the predicate offense 

have as an element a domestic relationship between the 

offender and the victim.

 And the Government's reading ignores the 

legislative compromise that led to the contested 

language; and, if adopted by this Court, would rewrite 

the statute and hand one side the legislative victory 

that they were unable to achieve in Congress.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. You say that 

that was the compromise. I don't know that you have any 

evidence to -- to show that that was an intentional --

an intentional alteration made in the House of 

Representatives. Do you? I mean --

MR. GIATRAS: There is nothing that speaks 

to the words in the House of Representatives in the

Congressional Record, Your Honor, but their inaction and 

the lack of words speak very loudly. And it was -- from 

March of 1996, when the legislation was introduced, and 

then it went over to the House after passing 

significantly in the Senate, it was stalled, and it was 

stymied, and it did not move.

 As a matter of fact, it had to at one time 

be taken from a -- and put into the stalking bill and 

then removed from the stalking bill and replaced back in 

then to a postal bill, which was then modified into the 

appropriations bill.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the other side says 

that the reason that was the case was that they objected 

to the fact that -- what was its language -- the -- the 

old version did not say a "misdemeanor crime of domestic 

violence." It was -- it was broader.

 MR. GIATRAS: It certainly was broader, but 

there was nothing -- and there was no one that spoke in 

the House of Representatives on that matter. And there 

was only one -- the principal author of the legislation, 

the sponsor, spoke in the Senate. And it was not until 

the eleventh hour on September 28th of 1996 that this 

entire change was made.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought it was that the 

use of force -- to make it clear is a misdemeanor -- had

to involve a use of force, and that wasn't clear before, 

right?

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where is the 

earlier version? Do we have the earlier version 

anywhere --

MR. GIATRAS: Yes.

brief -- I'm sorry. It's page 4a of the red brief.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: While we pause, can I just 

ask you one question to make sure I understand the two

ii is that the meaning you attributed to it is -- would 

be exactly the same if you left out the word 

"committed"? In other words, it seems to me under your 

view the word -- either the word "committed" or the 

words "committed by" is superfluous?

 MR. GIATRAS: No. That is part of the 

element -- the one element that is required.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why would you need that in 

there if the statute means -- if the element is the use

of force by a family member? Why do you have to put in 

another verb, "committed"?

 MR. GIATRAS: Well, because that's who --

that's who it would -- that's who it would address to. 

And that would be with respect to -- when you look at 

the definition that's set forth, it was to change from 

the original -- original --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I'm not interested 

in changes. I'm just interested in the text before us. 

And it seems to me that your reading of the statute is 

exactly what the statute would say if it did not include 

the word "committed."

 MR. GIATRAS: I -- I don't know, Justice. I 

don't believe so, though.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I agree with 

Justice Stevens. Read it without the word "committed." 

It not only has the same effect, but it's more natural, 

because it's "use of force by a current or former 

spouse," as opposed to "use of force committed by."

 MR. GIATRAS: It would still include -- it 

would still include both attributes into the one element 

even if the word "committed" were removed from double 

ii, yes. I'm -- I'm sorry about that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: As I read this old one --

as I read the first one, Senator Lautenberg put in the

language, and his language in the first one was to say 

I'll tell you a group of people who shouldn't have guns. 

The people who commit a crime of domestic violence.

 Now what's that? In the statute he says it 

is a misdemeanor crime of violence committed by a person 

in a family relation with the victim.

 Then he says after, I changed that language 

a little.  I'll tell you why. Because somebody told me 

misdemeanor crime of violence is too broad. It could 

include cutting up a credit card. So I'll define it 

more specifically.

 And he defines if more specifically to say 

that it is a crime that has as an element the use or 

attempted use of physical force or threatening people 

with a weapon. End of the matter.

 They substitute those words and they did 

another thing the drafter as he breaks out the thing it 

says: It is a crime that is a misdemeanor and, you see, 

and that's where the problem is, because if you put in a 

"that," then you have to have an "is." So he left out 

the "is." Okay.

 So I say what did Senator Lautenberg want 

with these words? I see. How did he change it? I see.

 I can't find a word that supports the reason 

that you have. Now, maybe they are there. That's what

you'll tell me.

 And then I say it's the fine language 

consistent with what he wanted. It requires putting in 

an "is." I don't find that too awful. Okay. That's 

your argument against you. What is it? Your argument 

to rebut that.

 MR. GIATRAS: The legislation that the 

Senator introduced was not the legislation that was 

passed by Congress. And, Justice Breyer, it is very 

clear from the statutory and legislative history in this 

case from -- you just take up through September 28th of 

1996, that the sponsor of the legislation decries with 

respect to the staunch opposition that was in the House, 

and the fact that his bill was going nowhere. This may 

have been his intended purpose with respect to what was 

introduced, but it was then the will of Congress with 

changing --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's the conclusion. 

You're reaching that conclusion. What I need from you 

is something that would tell me, no, Congress didn't 

just want to clarify in the way Lautenberg said. What 

they wanted to do was, in fact, restrict the scope of 

this so it only applied in 17 states. Okay. I'm open 

to that argument. It could be a good argument. Just 

point me to the things that suggest that that is what

Congress wanted to do, rather than by what Senator

the final passed legislation.

the best you can do is point me to the words of the 

statute, I'll take that into account. I'm asking the 

question to see if there is anything at all more?

structure of the statute also changed, and the structure 

of the statute changed --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't want the text. I 

want something for my purposes.

 MR. GIATRAS: What we have --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

 MR. GIATRAS: And what is problematic here, 

Justice, is that the legislative history does not speak 

on this particular matter. It is silent on this.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did this structure come 

from Senator Lautenberg?

 MR. GIATRAS: No, it did not.

on September 28th --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It came out of the House 

version. The House version had this which was different 

from the Senate version that Lautenberg was responsible 

for?

 MR. GIATRAS: No. This was a version that 

was passed in the Senate as the "as introduced" 

language. It then went and it was sat -- it sat in the 

House of Representatives for a long period of time.

 It was not until September 28th, prior --

right prior to the time that the budget bill had to have 

been sent back to -- to the Senate to be voted on and 

then proved by the President to continue the government 

to run. And this bill was changed then in the House of

Lautenberg would not have been the drafter of this 

language.

that Senator Lautenberg did not change the words 

"misdemeanor crime of violence" to the words "use of 

physical force" or "threatened use of deadly weapon"? 

That's what he got up on the floor of the Senate and 

said that he wanted to change.

 MR. GIATRAS: Justice, as this Court has 

articulated in Allapattah, that sometimes there can be a 

strategic manipulation to secure results.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not -- we're in -- the 

question specifically is where did the words come from? 

I thought that the words came from Senator Lautenberg. 

The reason I thought that is because he got up on the 

floor of the Senate and said that's what he did.

 Now, if you're telling me they came from a 

different place, what is there in anywhere? I'm open to 

hearing it, but I couldn't find anything that said they 

had come from a different place.

physical force or the threatened use of a deadly weapon

was occurring to his bill that it was dying, that it was 

being killed and it was being gutted in September of --

early to late September of 1996, the author says that 

his bill is being gutted and it's dying, and that there 

are significant staunch opposition from certain forces 

in order to limit the bill.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Other than a desire to 

weaken this bill as much as possible, can you think of 

any reason why Congress would have drawn the distinction 

that you're drawing between States that have specific 

statutes relating to domestic violence misdemeanor 

statutes and those that don't?

 MR. GIATRAS: I don't think we can speak why 

certain States did or did not or why Congress would only 

want there to be 17. But, certainly, there is 

nothing -- and there is nothing in the legislative 

history to express other than the fact that it was the 

effect of a judicial -- of a legislative compromise.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What sense would it make 

for Congress to say take two abusers? The conduct is 

identical. And in state A there is one consequence to 

bar on the possession of guns, and state B there isn't 

for the identical conduct, why would Congress want these 

two different results?

 MR. GIATRAS: It was -- the language that

was ultimately agreed upon by the entire Congress, Your 

Honor, was as a result of a compromise. And -- that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose it gives greater 

assurance of what exactly the prior conviction was. If 

there is just a prior conviction of misdemeanor 

violence, you have to go back, I suppose, and look at 

the conviction, look at the testimony to find out 

whether indeed it was domestic violence. It was just a 

general -- general assault statute. You don't know it 

was committed in the home or not.

 Whereas if you're -- if you're convicted of 

the crime, the misdemeanor of violence against a spouse 

or a relative like this, you know exactly what the --

what the crime is?

 MR. GIATRAS: You will know that. 

Certainly. And by even the -- the text of the statute, 

it changes from a crime of violence to the definition of 

misdemeanor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that -- that 

when someone purchases a firearm, they have to affirm, 

check a box, I have been convicted of a crime of 

domestic violence. Is that how it reads? And that goes 

to, you know, to the Federal Government and they check 

the records of convictions.

 How -- how would your client check that? I

domestic violence, if he had been convicted of assault 

and the assault happened to be domestic assault would --

would he be perjuring himself if he said no?

 MR. GIATRAS: There are -- there are cases 

that are prosecuted in that manner where also lying on 

the form gives charge -- gives rise to a Federal 

offense. And the ATF regulation is -- reads the statute 

slightly -- reads the statute -- it reads the statute 

significantly different and puts in parentheticals such 

as assault and/or battery and also puts in 

parentheticals how -- they use the word "was committed" 

in a -- in a third subparagraph.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does -- does it make clear 

whether the offense has to be domestic -- a domestic 

violence offense or whether an ordinary assault offense 

will qualify if as a matter of fact it was domestic?

 MR. GIATRAS: Well, it -- it -- the ATF 

regulation denotes that you should even put it down if 

it's going to be an assault and --

way the statute should have been drafted. Isn't that 

interesting.

 In other words, it breaks out the "was 

committed by a current or former spouse" and makes that 

a separate provision, rather than a part of the element 

"use of attempted force against a family member."

 MR. GIATRAS: That is correct, Your Honor, 

but that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's drafted the way 

it should have been if your friends are correct.

 MR. GIATRAS: That -- it's drafted the 

way -- it's drafted the way the original sponsor of the 

legislation would have wanted it to pass Congress, Your 

Honor -- or Chief Justice.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the -- the statute 

uses the word element in the term singular. It seems to 

me that although this statute is a mess anyway --

(Laughter).

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that that -- that that 

doesn't particularly help you. Elements usually refer 

to each component of the actus reus -- you entered a 

dwelling with a weapon. You would say "elements" for 

that, wouldn't you?

 And it seems to me under your interpretation 

the statute should say "elements."

MR. GIATRAS: Well, I think that the -- the 

best advice is to take that of judge Sentelle's 

dissenting opinion in Barnes where element or elements 

is insignificant, the plural of it. Instead it's what 

is the element as opposed to how many elements there 

are.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean when we are 

gasping for straws I'm not sure anything is 

insignificant.

 MR. GIATRAS: Well -- and in this particular 

matter, when in seeking -- if after seizing everything 

from which the aid can or may be derived, I think we can 

only guess as to Congress's intent.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But suppose this statute, 

the one that was enacted, had the word "if" before 

"committed." Would that then convey the meaning that 

the Government is urging? Has as an element use of 

force, comma, "if" committed.

 MR. GIATRAS: Well, that may make it 

slightly even more vague, Justice, because then it's 

whether or not it's even part or parcel or whether it is 

or isn't part of it. Here at least what they --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: "If committed" would 

break from "use of force." The element is the use of 

force, but then the crime would have to have been

committed by a current or former spouse; so wouldn't an 

"if" separate what is the element, that is, use of 

force?

 MR. GIATRAS: I don't believe that to 

use the word "if" changes our position, Justice --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, sure it would. Just 

as an "is" --

MR. GIATRAS: Well, "was," if --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if you want to add 

words you can add "if," you can add "as is," you could 

rewrite the statute a lot of ways.

 MR. GIATRAS: Well -- and one way is that 

this statute denotes that there is a part (c), of which 

there is no part (c). This statute also lacks -- even 

though it's very insignificant in and of itself, by 

itself -- it lacks a period at the very end of double i.

 Again, no one particular point can be --

would say that we would allow that punctuation to 

overcome the purpose, or overcome the text, but when 

taken as a whole, when you have the text and an 

inartfully drafted statute that references sections that 

don't exist, that has grammatical errors in it and that 

leaves things up to the reader to have to decide whether 

something is involved or not involved; and you also then 

have a lack of sufficient congressional record, then I

believe that it certainly is favored to look at the rule 

of lenity in this case. I do want to also --

JUSTICE ALITO: Do you really think there is 

a notice problem here?  If you had been advising 

Mr. Hayes after he was convicted of this misdemeanor, 

and you read this, would you say well, you know, you're 

-- it's a good thing that you were convicted of this in 

West Virginia, where there isn't a specific statute 

targeting domestic violence, because it doesn't cover 

you. If you had been convicted in another State under a 

specific domestic violence statute then you wouldn't be 

able to possess firearms but you're home free because of 

the nature of the statute in your State?

 MR. GIATRAS: I believe it would have 

been -- in 1993, '94 time period, it would have been 

very difficult -- it would have been, it should have 

been very easy to -- to advise Mr. Hayes with respect to 

that issue. Certainly. That he would not have lost his 

rights at that point.

 Thereafter when Congress passed this 

statute, then I believe that -- does it become a little 

murky? It probably does become a little murky. After 

you have the hindsight of being able to one, take a look 

at the legislative record if that's the necessary, 

and/or consider that, and/or if you take a look at the

ATF regulation, the only problem is the ATF regulation 

takes it -- takes us back in time to what they would 

have -- what would have been or what they would have 

liked it to have been as opposed to what was actually 

legislated.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if -- counsel 

advising Mr. Hayes surely would have looked at what was 

the uniform position in all the circuits. All the 

circuits that had this question before the floor read it 

the way the Government is urging. So counsel I think 

would have been highly irresponsible to advise Mr. Hayes 

that he would be home free, simply because his own State 

didn't have a separate domestic violence statute.

 MR. GIATRAS: And Justice Ginsburg, the only 

reason I say that in this particular case, is because 

Mr. Hayes was in 1993 -- and was pled in 1994, which was 

prior to enactment of this statute and/or any of the 

circuit court opinions. So that was my -- that was the 

reason for my answer that in Mr. Hayes' case it would 

have been very simple and no one would have looked to 

those issues because those didn't exist.

questions from the Chief Justice with respect to what 

States may have had these laws in 1996, on page 24 of

include Alabama, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Maine, 

North Carolina and the like. Kansas, and Mississippi.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Is that 

the right list? That's -- that's statutes passed after 

1996.

 MR. GIATRAS: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I looked at the 

amicus brief filed by the National Network, page 18 

footnote 53, and I see California, Illinois, Michigan, 

Ohio. Which is the right list?

 MR. GIATRAS: And that is the right list, 

Chief Justice, and that includes West Virginia in the 

1996, that was passed. And that is there on footnote 

number 53, just so it's correct.

 Our reading of the statute is more 

reasonable than the Government's. Certainly with 

respect to the variances of the grammatical errors and 

the grammatical leaps that the Government must take in 

order to substantiate its reading of the statute, we 

believe that ours is more reasonable.

 Likewise, the legislative history in this 

particular case is very weak, and if this Court even 

considers it, then I think you can take a look with 

respect to the text, the structure, the purpose and the

 MR. GIATRAS: Yes, Your Honor.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. SAHARSKY: Thank you. In this case, the 

Court has a choice between either reading the statute in 

a way that uses the words very unnaturally and unusually 

-- "committed by" to modify "use" and "element" --

treating a singular as plural, and the word "committed" 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if I could 

stop you there. The very first sentence in the United 

States Code, 1 U.S.C. section 1, says the singular 

includes the plural.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Right, and this Court has 

said that you do that only when two things are true: 

When it makes sense in context, and we think it doesn't 

because of the word "committed," which Respondent wants 

to read right out of the statute, and also because you 

do it when it's necessary to fulfill the evident 

purposes of the statute. And here, for the reasons we

explained, treating the singular as plural would be 

contrary to the purposes of the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know, but 

basically what you're saying is we don't follow 1 U.S.C. 

section 1 because our reading is correct. If they said, 

well, it doesn't -- you know, in context it doesn't 

fulfill the purposes and therefore we read "element" as 

singular only rather than according to section 1 of the 

United States Code.

 MS. SAHARSKY: It's because the element --

the singular "element" has other indicia meaning it 

involves the word "committed" and then also this -- the 

fact that Congress's objective would be stymied if you 

took Respondent's reading.

 So you've got a choice between just using 

the words unnaturally -- "committed by," taking 

"committed" and just making it superfluous, as in 

Respondent's view, or treating the singular "element" as 

plural, or you can give, as the Government is 

suggesting, a natural and logical reading that you're 

talking about an offense of this certain violent 

character committed by these certain people. And, yes, 

that involves looking slightly past Romanette (i) and 

(ii) structure to look at this being two clauses that 

both modify the word "offense." You --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You have to add words. It 

is unavoidable. To come to your reading, you must add 

words to the statute. To adopt the reading of the other 

side on the other hand, you need not add a single word. 

You just have to resign yourself to the -- to the usage 

that is unusual but not unheard of, that a particular 

use was committed. And the other side gives a number of 

examples, as does the brief by -- by linguists, a number 

of examples where that appears.

 So it's an unusual usage but not an unheard 

of usage. They don't have to add a single word or a 

single hard break in the text. You have to, to get to 

your construction.

 MS. SAHARSKY: With respect, Justice Scalia, 

we don't agree with that, and I'll give you two 

illustrations that hopefully would help establish that 

point: One, if you just read this all as a sentence 

without respect to the Romanettes (i) and (ii), you have 

an offense that is as a misdemeanor and has, as an 

element, committed by a certain group of persons. That 

reads as a sentence. There is an offense of a certain 

type committed by a certain group of persons.

 JUSTICE BREYER: For that, you'd have to 

assume that the GS-12 who drafted this, or whoever the 

equivalent was in the Senate, put the "that" in the

wrong place. If he had put the "that" after the (i) 

when he broke it down, it would all read as a sentence. 

The "that" would be for the first part, and you'd say 

"felony committed" for the part that interests us. Does 

that work?

 MS. SAHARSKY: I think it would read better 

that way. I think that it would --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You'd would have to put a 

"that" --

MS. SAHARSKY: It would read --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You'd have to put a "that" 

at the beginning of (ii) as well, wouldn't you?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Again, I think if you just --

I don't think you need to. I think you can just read 

through this all as one sentence. And we looked at that 

previous -- while were you talking with Respondent's 

counsel, you looked at that previous version of the bill 

Congress considered, and it just had it all as one 

sentence. It said "an offense of this certain character 

committed by this certain group of persons." And that 

same structure is in the statute as enacted, and that 

shows that the "committed by" refers back to "offense."

 And to get back to the point I opened with, 

the way that you choose between the two constructions in 

this case is to look at what Congress would achieve

under Respondent's construction of the statute, which is 

a statute that applies only in 17 States, not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And, again, not to 

beat a dead horse, but it's footnote 8 of your brief on 

page 23 that lists the 17 States. They include 

California, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Virginia. That 

wouldn't be a useless act by Congress to cover everybody 

in those States.

 MS. SAHARSKY: No, but it wouldn't be 

consistent with what Congress was intending, which is to 

solve the nationwide problem that every person who 

proved that they were willing to hurt their family 

members should not be able to possess a firearm, whether 

they're a felon or whether they were convicted of a 

misdemeanor. And that was the problem that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know, but you 

point was this doesn't do any good because it's only 17 

States. Those are -- there are a lot of people in those 

States.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Right, but some persons in 

those States who commit the same types of offenses, as 

Justice Ginsburg pointed out -- you know, they commit 

the same violent acts against family members. Some of 

them would be prosecuted under the regular -- under a 

specific domestic violence statute, but some would be

prosecuted under regular assault and battery statutes. 

And it doesn't make any sense, in those same States, to 

treat some people as being subject to the possession ban 

and some people as not being subject to that possession 

ban.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It makes it easier to 

identify it. You don't have to go back and look to see 

whether this particular assault conviction was an 

assault on a family member or not. It's there on the 

face of the indictment. Pretty important, it seems to 

me.

 MS. SAHARSKY: With respect, Justice Scalia, 

you can't just tell from the face of the State 

indictment whether you would not be able to possess a 

firearm under Federal law, because the domestic 

relationship covered by the State offenses, it is a 

broader universe in each of those 17 States. More 

domestic relationships are covered than are covered by 

the Federal statute. So you could have been convicted 

in one of those 17 States of a specific domestic 

violence offense, and still that would not necessarily 

be the case that you couldn't possess a firearm under 

Federal law, because they cover, for example, dating 

relationships.

raised but just to get back to one other point that came 

up with Respondent's counsel, when a person wants to buy 

a firearm, he fills out this particular form, Form 4473, 

and that form specifically says on that offenses like 

assault and battery are covered. The ATF regulation 

that has been in place since this statute was enacted 

says that those -- that offenses such as assault and 

battery are covered. In fact, all the courts of appeals 

up until recently, nine of them had this settled 

understanding. Aside from the ATF having it, Congress 

relied upon it. And we think that it makes sense.

 You should reverse the judgment below.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:50 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
