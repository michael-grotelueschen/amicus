 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 09-1036, Henderson v. 

Shinseki.

 Ms. Blatt.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The Federal Circuit's decision in this case 

forecloses judicial review when the very disability for 

which a veteran seeks benefits prevents the veteran from 

filing a timely appeal with the Veterans Court. That 

decision is wrong, and for three reasons the court of 

appeals erred in holding that the deadline at issue in 

this case is jurisdictional.

 First, the statute contains no clear 

indication that the deadline is jurisdictional. Rather, 

the text and structure point away from a jurisdictional 

reading.

 Second, a deadline that applies to disabled 

and largely uncounseled veterans seeking their first day 

in court is not the type of deadline that Congress would 

be expected to rank as jurisdictional.

And, third, a jurisdictional reading would 

render some of the most disabled of veterans the least 

likely to obtain benefits and would treat veterans worse 

off than almost all litigants in our Federal system.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blatt, you do have a 

substantial hurdle to contend with in this Court's 

decision in Bowles v. Russell, which seemed to say if 

you have a time limit and it's statutory, it is 

mandatory and jurisdictional.

 So here, we have a time limit set by 

statute, not by rule, and why doesn't -- why isn't that 

dispositive?

 MS. BLATT: Because neither this Court's 

decision in Bowles nor any other decision by this Court 

holds that this type of an appeal from a pro-claimant 

and non-adversarial proceeding to a court of first 

review clearly speaks in jurisdictional terms, 

notwithstanding the lack of a jurisdictional label.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, I thought Bowles was a 

nice, clear case. I mean, you can always find some 

distinction in the next case, and I thought the object 

of Bowles was to say if it's a -- if it's a limit on 

appeal, it's jurisdictional. That would -- and that's, 

I gather, what the Federal Circuit took it to mean. And 

I would have done that if I was down there, probably.

MS. BLATT: I mean, I can understand why 

maybe the Federal Circuit did it, because of the one 

statement that the court, I think, took out of context. 

But this Court's decision in Bowles didn't purport to 

extend to any statute, no matter what the statute said 

or what the context it arose in. And the most closely 

analogous context of an appeal of agency action to a 

court of first review is a Social Security context.

 And even if you don't think that that 

context is directly on point, then the historical 

backdrop at most would be inconclusive, and that hardly 

would rise to the type of -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: But doesn't -- doesn't the 

Social Security context -- it doesn't speak of an 

appeal, does it? It talks of a civil action.

 MS. BLATT: That's right. I mean, it -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you're right that 

-- you know, that there is -- there is a parallel in 

what's going on, but the statute does not call it an 

appeal. It calls it bringing a civil action -­

MS. BLATT: Right, and the -- and there's -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to challenge their 

decision.

 MS. BLATT: There's nothing inherently 

jurisdictional about the word "appeal." And,

Justice Scalia, if Congress that passed this statute 

wanted to pick up on the jurisdictional rule under 28 

U.S.C. 2107, presumably it would have written a statute 

that looks something like that statute with the safety 

valves.

 Of course, when a -- all litigants, civil 

litigants who are appealing a district court judgment to 

a court of appeals, they have a jurisdictional deadline, 

but the district court can extend it for good cause or 

excusable neglect or when the party lacks notice of an 

adverse judgment. More importantly, the Federal Rules 

of Appellate Procedure cure the situation when a 

litigant timely files his appeal but does so in the 

wrong forum.

 In this statute, Congress knew how to 

incorporate the jurisdictional rule of Bowles. It did 

so in a separate provision of the statute in 7292(a). 

It said when a litigant wants to go from the Veterans 

Court and appeal that decision to the Federal Circuit, 

the litigant has to follow the time and the manner 

prescribed for appealing district court judgments to 

court of appeals.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that is 

jurisdictional, 7292?

 MS. BLATT: Yes. Yes. And interestingly,

it also goes on to say if you want to appeal to this 

Court, you have to apply for certiorari. So Congress -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- so -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -- I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Go on.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm -- I'm not sure why 

Congress would have actually known the difference that 

we established in Bowles, because when it passed this 

statute, it was before Bowles, wasn't it?

 MS. BLATT: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what to read of its 

knowledge of Bowles, whether it meant jurisdiction or 

not, is -- is a bit of a fiction, isn't it?

 MS. BLATT: No. I think what's important is 

that Bowles is relying on a series of decisions that had 

nothing to do with the word "notice of appeal," of 

course, because they were dealing with cases involving 

writs of error and petitions for a writ of certiorari. 

It was all in the context of court-to-court appeals. 

Bowles doesn't even mention agency appeal of agency 

action to a court of first review.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's the rule? 

Justice Scalia said Bowles seemed to establish a 

sensible, clear rule, which is if Congress uses the word 

"notice of appeal," it intends a jurisdictional

 MS. BLATT: Well, what -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That appears to be the 

rule that Justice Scalia articulated.

 What would be your rule or test now to 

determine Congress's purpose? What -- what of our cases 

would you point to that establish a different rule?

 MS. BLATT: The rule of Reed Elsevier, which 

was a unanimous decision, which says -- and it was 

written by the same author of Bowles -- that all the 

decisions are consistent. You require a clear statement 

of jurisdictional intent. And in Bowles, this Court had 

read the type of limitation that was at issue in Bowles 

as to clearly speak in jurisdictional terms, 

notwithstanding a label. Here, you have -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure what that 

distinction is. I'm sorry. It -­

MS. BLATT: You had a century -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what we went on was 

the word "notice of appeal" in Bowles, with -- within a 

historical context.

 MS. BLATT: I don't think this Court said 

the word "notice" -- and notice of appeal is not 

jurisdictional in the criminal context, and Congress 

used the word "appeal" throughout this particular

statute in a non-jurisdictional meaning in all the 

proceedings that go in the agency. It used the term 

"appellate" and "review on appeal." It's actually 

called the Board of Veterans' Appeal. Substantive 

appeal. None of those words have "jurisdictional." And 

if Congress was just thinking of the word "notice of 

appeal," it -- I mean, the term has a non-jurisdictional 

meaning in the criminal context.

 But if you just look at this statute, which 

says -- it's directed just at the litigant's obligation 

to file his -- his appeal within a certain time line, 

and there's actually a completely separate statute that 

speaks to the power of the court, the Veterans Court, 

7252(a), and that makes no reference to the 120-day 

deadline.

 And I think in terms of the context, 

let's -- this is exactly the type of deadline that 

Congress would be expected to be subject to equitable 

tolling. Let me just give you the three reasons -­

JUSTICE ALITO: When you -- you would have 

us make a statute-by-statute determination as to what we 

think Congress intended whenever it uses the term 

"notice of appeal." And perhaps that's not a big 

problem, if there are not a lot of other statutes like 

this one that use the term "notice of appeal" and with

respect to which it is not settled whether it is 

jurisdictional.

 Do you have any sense of how many others 

there might be?

 MS. BLATT: Yes. I think I found four that 

used the term "notice of appeal," and it was in 

connection with the district court, and they weren't 

even reported cases. They were very esoteric 

situations, like an order from the Department of 

Agriculture. I mean, maybe the Government has 

different.

 What you mostly see is the Hobbs Act 

context, where you're talking about either an organic 

statute or 28 U.S.C. 2344, which is just a simple 

petition for review. That doesn't even use the word 

"notice of appeal." So this case is not going to 

dictate a whole lot, except for the veterans context, 

where not only do you have the standard lack of 

indication that this is not jurisdictional, but you have 

the unique features in that Congress established this 

court to open the door to veterans seeking disability 

benefits, and it would just conflict with that purpose 

to, at the same time, shut the door when the veteran's 

disability prevents him from getting to the courthouse.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Although that -- although

that would happen when he appeals from the -- from the 

veterans' appeals court, right?

 MS. BLATT: Yes, and -- but that points out 

the irony: He's in better off shape if he appeals to 

the court of appeals, because there, there's at least 

important exceptions.

 The Government's position assumes that no 

matter what the circumstances were -- and remember, a 

lot of these cases, the veteran is actually timely 

filing his appeal; he mistakenly files in the Veterans 

Administration rather than the Veterans Court. And the 

Government's position assumes that these uncounseled 

veterans are simply out of time and out of luck with no 

exception.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How much time does 7292 

give to go from the Veterans Court to the Federal 

Circuit?

 MS. BLATT: It says you have to follow the 

exact time and procedure that is set forth in the 

process for appealing a United States district court 

decision to the United States courts of appeals. So it 

is the procedures under 28 U.S.C. 2107.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But this one, to get to the 

Veterans Court, is 120 days, which is a lot of time. Do 

you know of any other time limit that is that long?

charge with the EEOC. But in the veterans context -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, for appeal. For 

appeal.

 MS. BLATT: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know of any other 

appeal statute that -­

MS. BLATT: Yes, the veterans context. The 

-- this is a blink of an eye in the veterans context. 

The veteran is given an entire year -- not 120 days, a 

year -- after an initial decision comes down from a 

regional office to decide whether to appeal to the 

Boards of Veterans' Appeals.

 And you have to keep in mind that this is 

the type of extra time we're talking about. An extra 30 

to 60 days would be an extremely poor and unlikely means 

for Congress to address the type of situation where 

equitable tolling might be needed, which is either 

because the Secretary has held onto the notice of appeal 

until after the 120 days and then tells the veteran, or 

the veteran has some devastating mental illness and has 

difficulty with processing deadlines and dealing with 

concepts.

understand, but I don't have a whole lot of sympathy 

for -- I mean, when he loses below, he gets a notice 

that says specifically he has to file an appeal with 

this court, doesn't it? Doesn't it say that?

 MS. BLATT: Yes, and it says -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: So he sends it -- he sends 

it to the VA instead of to this court?

 MS. BLATT: Well, it is a -- you can look it 

up. It's -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Would equitable tolling 

even cover that situation? It would seem to me -- I'd 

say it told you where to file; you simply didn't follow 

the instructions.

 MS. BLATT: Not only has the Federal Circuit 

ruled en banc that it does, but this Court's decision in 

Irwin and in United States v. Young specifically 

recognized that a classic equitable tolling situation is 

when there's no prejudice to the other side and the 

litigant files in the wrong forum.

 And you have to keep in mind, there's a 

Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure on point. Rule 4(d) 

says when a litigant mistakenly files his notice of 

appeal in the court of appeals, that's presumed to be 

correctly filed in the district court. And whatever you 

think about what your -- what an average-type person

might see when they see a two-page single-spaced form 

with a lot of legalese, it's -- this form is difficult 

for a lawyer to read, and to expect -- the vast majority 

of the claimants reading this form are uncounseled. And 

I urge you to read the form. It doesn't just say you 

have 120 days to appeal. It goes on and on and on 

telling -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that? Is that -­

MS. BLATT: It's cited in the Government's 

brief. It's got the VA form, and I -- I had to look it 

up just by punching it in on the Internet.

 But whatever you think about the clarity -­

of someone -- of your statute -- that might be able to 

understand it, time and time again, veterans file in the 

wrong forum. And it's not always just the veteran's 

fault. Sometimes the Secretary is giving the veteran 

misleading advice. We cite cases in our brief, and so 

do the amici, where the Veterans Administration is 

giving the veteran just misleading advice.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blatt, you are 

making -- you said that the closest comparison is in the 

Social Security, because there's disability benefits in 

both cases. Apart from that we -- one is commenced by a 

complaint filed in the district court, the other, a 

notice of appeal, is there any difference in the brand

of review? That is -- as I understand it, Social 

Security review, although it's by the district court, is 

also on the administrative record.

 MS. BLATT: Well, it's purely appellate, and 

district courts always say when they get these things: 

This is an appeal of a Social Security decision.

 But I think the three reasons that I'm 

trying to get on why this is precisely the type of 

deadline that Congress would not rank as jurisdictional 

and would want to be subject to equitable tolling are 

the -- pretty much the reasons that apply even more so 

in the veterans context.

 And that is, the first, is that this is an 

extremely favored class of litigants. These are 

veterans who have fought for their country and who are 

seeking service-connected disability benefits.

 This is also the veterans' first opportunity 

to get to a court, which is true in the Social Security 

system. And, importantly, the vast majority of veterans 

go to the court without counsel. The numbers are over 

50 to 70 percent. And that was true in the Social 

Security system.

 I don't think that -­

perhaps, the other way is that it's not a real 

adversarial system before you get to that stage. It's a 

collaborative effort, the Veterans Administration and 

the -- the individual.

 MS. BLATT: That's right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which seems to me 

may counterbalance a little bit the fact that the 

veterans are uncounseled.

 MS. BLATT: Well, I mean, up until 2006, 

they were actually barred from having lawyers.

 But this is the same thing as the Social 

Security context, which is what this Court relied on 

unanimously in Bowen, in holding that it's not 

jurisdictional, and it's also what this Court relied on 

in Zipes, is that you wouldn't expect Congress to enact 

an inflexible, harsh, no exceptions whatsoever 

jurisdictional deadline when Congress presumably knew 

that the vast majority of people who would be navigating 

this system, coming out of this extremely informal 

adversarial system where the Secretary had a duty to 

actually assist the veteran and then hitting what is 

then an adversarial system, and you would think that you 

would want equitable tolling. The -­

percent -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right, but do they 

-- do they drop them like a hot potato once the VA 

portion is over? They don't counsel about how to file 

an appeal?

 MS. BLATT: That's correct, but I wouldn't 

say they drop them like a hot potato. These are people 

who are sitting in the VA, and they -- remember, like in 

this case, it's 3 years later; they don't even get 

notice of the final decision, which is just sent to the 

veteran. They don't have any kind of lawyer 

relationship. It's like someone at one of the VA 

offices who says: Let me help you, tell you what to do. 

And then that's it. So, no, they don't -- they don't 

practice in Veterans Court. They don't -- they don't 

say, you know, here's my card, let's keep in touch. And 

it might be 3 to 4 years later that a notice is sent to 

the veteran.

isn't assisted -- he is not assisted by one of these

 Of course, they don't participate in the 

court. They're not -- they're not lawyers. But it's 

not clear to me why they wouldn't participate at least 

in the process of saying you've got to file your notice 

and here's where you file it.

 Are you saying they don't do that?

 MS. BLATT: They, by and large, don't do 

that, and the veterans' organizations that filed amicus 

briefs say they also make the same mistake. They're not 

lawyers, and they often file in the wrong forum, too.

 That makes sense prospectively, but it 

doesn't make sense to do that to statues that were 

passed before we announced our bright-line preference.

 MS. BLATT: Well, it doesn't sense to say in 

1988 Congress was trying to map onto some -- some 

pre-existing structure that didn't exist. Bowles didn't 

exist. You may -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I'm trying -- I 

understand -- changing the subject -- but in my 

question, you invoked the bright-line rule of Arbaugh 

that the statute should say "jurisdictional." And I'm 

just saying that only makes sense prospectively.

 MS. BLATT: I can see your point. I don't 

think that that's what Arbaugh intended. I think it 

said that when you have a statutory requirement and when 

it doesn't speak to the jurisdiction of the court, 

there's no reason to think that it should restrict the 

jurisdiction of the court. This doesn't say anything 

about the court's power.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blatt, are you -- are 

you -- we have in Bowles itself -- it was from the 

district court to the court of appeals, and then we have 

from the court of appeals to this Court. Those two

provisions were cited in Bowles, the 2107. And what is 

the provision for -- for cert?

 MS. BLATT: 2101(c).

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 2101. Those -- those, as 

far as I remember, were the only provisions that were 

cited.

 MS. BLATT: Well, and the predecessors 

called writ of error. Right, they were -- I mean, this 

couldn't be further from it. Congress, when it passed 

this statute, said you have 120 days to file your 

appeal. And then in a whole -- and said -- didn't say 

anything about the jurisdiction. And a separate version 

said: Here's the jurisdiction, and we'll incorporate 

some procedural requirements, but we're not even going 

to mention the 120-day deadline. And then it goes to 

great pains to say 2107 will apply when you appeal from 

the Veterans Court to the Federal Circuit, and you'll 

have to apply for certiorari.

 But to think about what the Government's 

position is, is that, notwithstanding that criminal 

defendants and Social Security claimants do not face 

jurisdictional deadlines, all the civil litigants in our 

system who do face jurisdictional deadlines can get an 

extension for good cause, excusable neglect, when they 

don't have notice of an adverse judgment, and the

limits in the future that do not contain any -- any 

explicit provision for waiver of failure to meet those

hold is that when you have a -- this particular statute, 

which the text and structure certainly say it's not 

jurisdictional, it is exactly the -- it is not the type 

of deadline you would expect it, and it would undermine 

all of the purposes that Congress set up this court, 

which was to ensure they had their day in court, they 

get the benefits they are entitled to, and, importantly, 

to cure the perception that veterans were being -- not 

being treated the way all other claimants seeking 

Federal benefits were.

 This would completely counter that purpose, 

to say: Here's a court; we have built it for you, but 

if you can't get up the courthouse steps, that's too 

bad. If your very disability prevents you from filing 

or you've been abused by the VA -- the VA bureaucracy, 

you're out of luck and out of court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Although you're willing 

to -- to allow that happen when there's an appeal 

from -- from the first appeal, right?

 MS. BLATT: And here's why, Justice Scalia. 

The veteran has had a day in court. Once he is out of 

the Veterans Court, he is like every -- or she is like 

every other litigant in our Federal system, which -- the 

deadline applies to the government; the deadline applies 

to the party -- to any party. That's 2107, which

applies to all civil litigants equally. They've had 

their day in court, and if it's in the Hobbs Act 

context, usually they've had some sort of adversarial, 

court-like proceeding in the administrative agency.

 But no decision -- and, again, keep in mind 

there were three decisions in the Social Security 

context -- no decision has ever said a pro-claimant, 

non-adversary appeal to a court of first review is 

jurisdictional. So Congress was acting against that 

backdrop.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that was -­

MS. BLATT: There's no such decision.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the Federal 

Circuit's position until Bowles, right? But this was an 

en banc decision, and it overruled two prior cases -­

MS. BLATT: Right. And they did go back and 

forth, so there was a period of 6 years that they held 

it was jurisdictional, and then a period of 11 years, 

the last 11 years, where it has been non-jurisdictional, 

and there has been equitable tolling.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If the veteran is so 

profoundly disabled that the veteran can't file the 

notice of appeal within 120 days after the notice of the 

decision, at what point after the 120-day period would 

the right to file a notice of appeal be cut off? Would

 MS. BLATT: No. I mean, in adopting 

equitable tolling by the Federal Circuit for mental 

disabilities -- that case is Barrett v. Principi on 

page 9 of our brief. It goes through how all the sister 

circuits have dealt with the issue of mental disability 

and Title VII, in the Social Security system, and -- and 

how you would deal with that.

 But let's take this case, because it's a 

good example. The doctor said he was -- he's paranoid 

schizophrenic, so he's having periods, and what -- to 

quote the doctor that was submitted to the Veterans 

Court, he had episodes of what was basically called 

psychomotor retardation and total inability to function, 

and at other times he was just simply disorganized, had 

difficulty with recall and memory.

 So he wrote a handwritten note within 

15 days saying: I've been on and off. And he was 

obviously extremely heavily medicated.

 If I could reserve the balance of my time.

please the Court:

 In Bowles v. Russell, this Court reaffirmed 

its longstanding treatment of statutory time limits for 

the taking of appeals as jurisdictional. Section 

7266(a) imposes a 120-day time limit on the taking of an 

appeal to the Veterans Court, and under the rule 

reaffirmed in Bowles, that time limit is a limit on the 

court's jurisdiction, and the judgment of the court of 

appeals should be therefore be affirmed.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's only -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, in Bowles 

it was from an Article III court to another Article III 

court. Here, although we're dealing with an Article I 

court, there are characteristics of what you might call 

internal agency review. The court is specialized with 

respect to veterans' affairs, and there are particular 

standards for review that you don't find when you're 

talking about between the district court and the court 

of appeals.

 MR. MILLER: Well, I -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess it's 

related -- just to get everything out on the table, it's

that lawyers had long recognized as being, you know, a 

drop-dead date.

 MR. MILLER: That -- that is true, but what 

Bowles emphasized was not just the historical treatment 

of the particular time limit in section 2107, but the 

historical treatment of statutory time limits for 

appeals in general, which is why the Court cited not 

only 2107 cases but -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It didn't mention --

Bowles didn't mention anything like an appeal from an 

agency where the district court is -- is sitting, 

essentially, as an appellate court.

 But Bowles really was dealing with 

court-to-court, because it mentioned 2107 and 2101, and 

I don't recall that it mentioned any -- anything other 

than court-to-court situations.

 MR. MILLER: You're -- you're correct that 

Bowles was focused on court-to-court appeals, but, of 

course, in Stone v. INS, which involved a deadline for 

petitioning for review of a final decision of the Board 

of Immigration Appeals, the Court held that that time 

limit was jurisdictional. So I think that the same 

principle applies to appeals from agencies -­

is an adversarial proceeding, the immigration 

proceeding, and the veterans' is supposed to be 

claimant-friendly.

 But I think that the -- the -- just as 

Bowles is -- is a challenge for Ms. Blatt, so for you is 

the Social Security context, because it seems to me the 

quality of review is the same; that is, what the 

district court does in a Social Security disability case 

is the same thing that the Veterans Court does in a 

veteran's disability case.

 MR. MILLER: It -- it is true that 

functionally, the review that takes place under section 

405(g) has a lot of appeal-like features, but what's -­

and so in that sense, you know, Bowen was like a hybrid 

case, because you have something that looks a little bit 

like an appeal, but it takes place in a district court 

and in a court of original jurisdiction, and, most 

importantly, Congress referred to it as a civil action 

that is commenced by the party who is filing a 

complaint.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it is -- it is an 

appellate review, isn't it? I mean, the district court 

goes on the record before the agency.

 MR. MILLER: The -- the review is very much 

like -- functionally like what would happen in the court

of appeals, but Congress chose to call it commencing a 

civil action. And you commence it by filing a 

complaint, which is quite different from the notice of 

appeal here. On the notice of appeal, there's a form 

for doing it, or if you don't use the form, all it takes 

is one sentence. And -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Are we supposed to still 

pay some attention to what we think Congress would have 

intended?

 MR. MILLER: Certainly.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And if the 

answer is "certainly," how likely do you think it is 

that Congress would have intended its statutes, in an 

ordinary case where two big businesses are suing each 

other and they've already had a day in court and now one 

of them wants to appeal and Congress writes in, if you 

miss the deadline, you can have it extended through 

excusable neglect, and you can even have it extended 

much later if nobody got a notice. That's with two big 

businesses.

 But if you have someone who served his 

country and was wounded and has post-traumatic stress 

syndrome or schizophrenia, to that person you say -- who 

has never had a day in court -- if you don't meet the 

deadline, you are out, no matter how excusable it is.

 MR. MILLER: Well -- I think in evaluating 

what Congress thought in 1988, one factor that's 

significant is that this was taking place -- the 

Veterans' Judicial Review Act -- against a backdrop of 

decades of no judicial review whatsoever of veterans' -­

of VA administrative decisions.

 And so Petitioner's position is that 

essentially, Congress, in one fell swoop, went from no 

review whatsoever to what would be the most forgiving 

appeal deadline in the entire United States Code. 

And -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it made some 

sense. I mean, when you look at the statistics, when

win, you assume that Congress wouldn't want to cut them 

off, because it's -- you know, if only 1 percent of the 

veterans appealing win, then you might understand an 

absolute rule, because they're not as -- statistically 

anyway, we're not losing much.

 But if, as I understand to be the case, 

about 80 percent of them win, you might cut them a 

little slack on appealing because it is a very 

significant part of the -- the process.

 MR. MILLER: First, I would say I think the 

reversal rate is not necessarily out of line with what 

you find in other agency review contexts, but -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what is the 

reversal rate?

 MR. MILLER: I think, of cases that are 

decided on the merits, about a quarter are reversed and 

remanded, and about 34 percent are affirmed in part and 

reversed in part.

normal rule is from district court to court of appeals?

percentage there, but I think in considering that rate,

it's significant that the great majority of claimants

 And so only about 4 percent of cases are 

even appealed all the way from the regional office to 

the board, and only another 9 percent to the Veterans 

Court, so -- because the board gives relief in most 

cases before it. So it's not like -­

not?

court. Do you have any case, at the time or before the 

statute was passed, that ever held that a statutory 

deadline from an agency to a court of appeal was 

jurisdictional in the sense of Bowles?

 MR. MILLER: Stone v. INS, which was 

after 1988 -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well after.

 MR. MILLER: But -- but in the courts of 

appeals, there was a long history of cases under the 

Hobbs Act, cases under more specialized statutes, the 

Communications Act, the Federal Power Act, and the 

environmental statutes -­

language. They used "barred" language rather than

Act says a party aggrieved by the order may seek review 

by filing a petition for review. It doesn't say 

anything about "and a claim shall be barred if you 

don't."

written into it. And the fact that there are exceptions 

written into it lends some support to the notion that 

we, as a court, should not read other exceptions into it 

that weren't mentioned. Now, that's something the Court 

seemed to emphasize.

 And here, when I looked at this statute, I 

noticed there are no exceptions written into it. And, 

therefore, following Bowles rather than rejecting 

Bowles, it would seem that Bowles would support the 

reading of this statute to allow courts to read into it, 

because they don't mention anything themselves.

 MR. MILLER: I would say two things about 

that. The first is that there are many statutes, 

including the Hobbs Act, the immigration statute, that 

have no provision for exceptions. This Court's 

certiorari deadline can be extended by a justice, but 

there is no provision for a good cause exception. The 

extension provision that was specifically at issue in 

section 2107 in Bowles hadn't -- wasn't even enacted 

until 1991. And even with an extension, I'm not aware 

of any other provision that gives you as much as 120 

days that you have here.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's the main thing. 

Leaving that out for a second, if you -- if you thought 

there can't be a rule that governs all of the thousands

of different -- or many different statutes, you should 

look at the context.

 So sometimes you will see that Congress, 

given the context, probably did want to give the court 

some leeway to make exceptions -- where, for example, 

it's no fault of the litigant -- and in other instances, 

they didn't.

 Now, you've listed -- and Bowles, I thought, 

left that open. But -- but if it does leave it open, 

and I'm looking to those factors, you've mentioned one: 

That this is a long period of time, 120 days. You're 

right about that.

 Is there anything else?

 MR. MILLER: Well, I -- I guess I would take 

issue with the premise of what the presumption is that 

Bowles set up.

 Bowles established a presumption that notice 

of appeal deadlines in statutes are jurisdictional 

unless there is something in the text or in the history 

as, for example -­

JUSTICE BREYER: And what they found, one 

thing in the text, was that there were exceptions 

written in. That cuts against you.

 MR. MILLER: I mean, what we're emphasizing 

is that this is an appeal deadline, and in Bowles, 

although it is true there were exceptions there, that 

was not something that the Court emphasized in its 

reasoning. The Court's -- the rationale behind Bowles 

is that there's a presumption that appeal deadlines are 

jurisdictional. And whatever one thinks -­

JUSTICE ALITO: What happens if the -- if 

the notice of decision is mistakenly mailed to the wrong 

address, comes back undeliverable, and no further notice 

is sent? Your -- you position is, once the 120 days 

expires, the veteran is out of luck?

 MR. MILLER: No, Your Honor, because in that 

case, the 120 days wouldn't start running because 

section 7266(a) says have you to file within 120 days 

after the date on which notice of the decision is mailed 

pursuant to section 7104(e), and section 7104(e), in 

turn, requires that the notice be mailed to the address 

of record for the claimant, and also, incidentally, 

requires that if the claimant has an authorized 

representative in proceedings before the court, that the 

notice also be mailed to the representative.

address, but it's lost in the mail or is not received by 

the veteran? What is the veteran supposed to do? Call 

every -- every week to see whether a decision has been 

issued?

 MR. MILLER: I -- I think Congress, in 

writing the statute, assumed that the mail can be relied 

upon in the ordinary course to be delivered, and so it 

made provision for the case in which the mail -- the 

mailing is not made.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you say that a copy 

of the notice is also sent to the representative, the 

American Legion or whoever, who has been representing

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You made a point earlier 

that, well, this is -- the Social Security, there are 

many resemblances, but one is started by complaint and 

the other by notice of appeal. It could be that 

Congress, having been so kind to veterans, thought: Why 

should we burden this pro se, or at least lawyer-less, 

veteran with writing out a complaint? The notice of 

appeal is just a simple one-line document.

 So could that explain why Congress said you 

begin with a notice of appeal instead of a formal 

complaint?

 MR. MILLER: I think that may well be what 

Congress had in mind. But, nonetheless, the -- the rule 

established in this Court's cases is that when a notice 

of appeal deadlines -- and -- and I think that point 

just illustrates that this is, in fact, a notice of 

appeal deadline -- notice of appeal deadlines are 

different from statutes of limitations. And whatever 

one thinks of the original theoretical underpinnings of 

that distinction, it's a distinction that's firmly 

engrained in the law, and this -­

assume we -- we come out with a decision against the

know, go back and do it over again and give it to this 

guy?

 MR. MILLER: I -- I believe that, you know, 

since what's at stake is -- I think, ultimately, the 

question would be whether the government issues a 

monetary award to him. And Congress certainly has the 

power to simply direct that money be paid to this 

claimant. So, for sure, I think it could direct that 

his case be reopened.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's no -- been no 

determination on the merits whether this claimant should 

prevail.

know if this is a good or bad claim.

 MR. MILLER: Right, but I -­

award money because there has to be an adjudication.

 MR. MILLER: Congress would have the 

constitutional power to just award money.

 I had understood Justice Scalia's question 

to be whether -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Scalia just asked 

you: Could this be -- if Congress decided that this was 

a harsh result, could it be made retroactive? But for 

Congress to say, well, just -- what is it going to rely 

on to say whether it gives compensation or not? I mean, 

the Government's position was he wasn't entitled to 

compensation for home care, which is what he was 

seeking.

 MR. MILLER: Right. The question I was 

trying to address was whether Congress could amend the 

statute so as to retroactively reopen Petitioner's 

claim. And my answer was yes, it could do that, if it 

were to choose to do so.

would not apply retroactively, but Congress in its 

discretion could choose.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: On the length of time, 

which is, you said, 120 days -- yes, that's a long time, 

but isn't it on cert? It's 90 days plus 60, right? So 

it's even more.

 MR. MILLER: Right. Although if you -- I 

mean, if somebody who misses the 90 days -- my 

understanding of the operation of this Court's Rule 13 

is that the clerk will not accept for filing a petition 

filed on day 91.

days would exceed 120, assuming that the application is 

made -­

or 40 cases where the veteran perhaps wasn't represented 

and maybe had some stress syndrome, whatever it is. He 

just filed the paper in the wrong court, and the -- or 

the wrong agency, and that agency didn't get around to 

returning it to him in time so he could have met this 

deadline.

 What, in your opinion, is supposed to happen 

in those circumstances? Just say too bad, you're out of 

luck; there we are, you got the wrong address; no 

recovery?

 MR. MILLER: I think it's significant that 

Congress did address the question of mailing of notices 

of appeal. In 1994, it amended section 7266 and added a 

subsection (c), which unfortunately is not reproduced in 

the briefs, but that -- the effect of that is to give 

the benefit of a mailbox rule so that a petition is 

deemed filed on the day it is mailed, but only, quote, 

"if the notice is properly addressed to the court." So 

it's significant -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, in all these cases, 

actually, that they've raised in the brief, the veteran 

does get his appeal.

notice would not have been properly addressed to the 

court. It would have been sent somewhere else and -­

 MR. MILLER: And certainly one would hope 

that the VA, you know, ideally would get those notices, 

figure out what they are, and send them to the court. 

The problem that the VA encounters is that it receives a 

tremendous volume of mail, which is not generally opened 

by attorneys, and it's often not clear when it gets 

something in the mail that just says, you know, I don't 

like the decision in my case, whether that's a notice of 

appeal to the court or a motion for reconsideration or a 

motion to file a new claim -­

 MR. MILLER: Well, yes, and we -- we do not

say that there is no equitable tolling is to say that 

there will be cases in which the result is not 

equitable. But -- and I think if you were to look at

some of the others in Petitioner's brief and in the 

amicus briefs, and if you could identify with no 

transaction costs what those cases are and were to ask, 

as a policy matter, should there be -- should the late 

filing be excused in those cases, I think just about 

everyone would say yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And so if we're in a void 

and the language doesn't have the exceptions -- and I 

think you can distinguish it from these other cases, and 

you have older cases that says unless Congress is clear, 

read it as non-jurisdictional, and nobody could say it 

was inequitable -- or rather to the contrary, nobody 

could say it was equitable to follow your position here, 

why isn't there a simple remedy? We take the opposite 

position?

 MR. MILLER: Well, I think there are two 

answers to that, and the first is that whatever you 

think of the rule in Bowles -- and we obviously believe 

that it was correctly decided but understand that not 

everyone takes that view -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Except that for purposes of 

this, it governs. I'm just looking at the parts of it

particular provision at issue in that case.

whether a particular time limit is or is not 

jurisdictional would seem to be a quintessential example 

of the sort of issue where it is more important that the 

law be settled than that it be settled any particular 

way.

 And the great virtue of the rule in Bowles 

is that it provides clear guidance that appeal deadlines 

are going to be presumed to be jurisdictional, and if 

Congress doesn't want them to be, it can say so.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's really the only 

thing that counsels your result, because in Reed you 

took -- the Government took the position that a 

statutory provision is non-jurisdictional if it does not 

speak in jurisdictional terms and doesn't address the 

power of the court. I understand that was the 

Government's position in Reed.

 Today you're saying that the only thing that 

counsels your result is the fact that Congress used the 

words "notice of appeal." Is that correct?

 MR. MILLER: Yes. Our position is 

consistent with what we said in Reed, because Reed, of 

course, did not involve a time limit. Reed involved the 

requirement that copyrights be registered before an 

infringement action is brought. And what the Court said 

in Reed is that the presence or absence of a

jurisdictional label on the statute is not 

determinative. What's -- what matters is whether the 

type of limitation that the statute imposes is one 

that's properly ranked as jurisdictional, absent a 

label. And if -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any -- any 

statute on the time to appeal? Has any statute been 

held, quote, "jurisdictional" when there is no safety 

valve of any kind written into it; that is, that -- on 

2107, that extensions are possible? Is -- is there a, 

quote, "jurisdictional" statute that says 121 days or 

whatever, and that's it; no extension, no matter what 

the circumstances are?

 MR. MILLER: Yes. The Immigration and 

Nationality Act at issue in Stone has no provision for 

extensions. The Hobbs Act has no provision for 

extensions. And many of the various agency-specific 

statutes that I mentioned earlier don't have any 

provisions for extensions. And although this Court 

hasn't ruled on them, Petitioner hasn't identified any 

decision from any court of appeals holding that any of 

those statutes is not jurisdictional.

 So there really is, as recognized in Bowles, 

a uniform rule regarding time limits for the taking of 

appeals and proceedings like appeals, writs of

district court, and the Court nonetheless held that 

because the time limit was jurisdictional, there was no 

authority to create an exception to it.

 If there are no further questions, we ask 

that the judgment be affirmed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Ms. Blatt, you have 4 minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 Let me just point out on the Hobbs Act, the 

actual statute says the jurisdiction is invoked by 

filing a timely petition for review. So there's an 

express jurisdictional hook. And I think Justice Scalia 

points out an interesting fact on -- I think it's safe 

to say, in 1988, Congress wasn't sitting down thinking 

is this deadline jurisdictional; they're subject to 

equitable tolling.

 What we had is a period where veterans were 

not given judicial review. We had World War II and the 

Vietnam conflict and the Korean conflict, which made it 

just untenable that veterans were not being treated on 

par with other claimants seeking disability benefits. 

And the sponsor of the bill points out, since Social 

Security disability benefits get judicial review, how

can we not treat our nation's veterans the same?

 Now -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I want to 

clear up this represent -- represented business.

 MS. BLATT: Sure.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understood you to 

say in the -- your opening that represented -- most of 

these people are not represented, and they're -- to the 

extent the American Legion participates, they don't get 

notice of the order that triggers the 120 days.

 Now, I understood Mr. Miller to tell us that 

80 percent of the people have registered representatives 

and they do get notice.

 MS. BLATT: Right. I think you correctly 

understand that we have a different understanding of 

reality. So my understanding is that representation 

is -- like the -- Mr. Henderson's wife at one point 

tried to become his authorized representative. There is 

no question he had somebody helping him, a veteran's 

service organization process.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

 MS. BLATT: This can take up to 4 or 5 

years -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

 MS. BLATT: No, not that I know of. But 

this is not -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is that the 

exception, then? I mean, Mr. Miller tells us 80 percent 

of the people do have registered representatives.

 MS. BLATT: Right. I understand, and I'm 

just telling you that my understanding from not only 

just the amici briefs, that they do not have anything to 

deal with the court, is that the veterans organizations 

don't have notice. They are the ones that are filing in 

this case telling you that this decision will be 

disastrous for them. But even if they do, they are 

uncounseled. They are not lawyers.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it won't be disastrous 

if they can ask to be registered.

 MS. BLATT: I agree. But these are -- the 

veterans' service -- like in this case, where he lives 

in North Carolina, there's only, like, 50 VA regional 

offices. So his representative may be 100, 200 miles 

away, and there's not that kind of connection. But if 

the case comes -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't matter 

how far away they are if he gets notice.

MS. BLATT: They don't -- I understand, and 

I'm just -- my understanding is that they either -- they 

don't get notice, and even if they have notice, they 

have -- feel no obligation, because they're not in a 

representative capacity at that point, that they would 

process his appeal or advise him.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why give them notice? 

I mean, isn't the very giving of -- of notice -­

MS. BLATT: Right. And I -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- an indication that they 

are expected to do something?

 MS. BLATT: And I understand the Government 

representing that there's notice, and I'm telling you 

that is not my understanding; that when he said 

authorized representative, I don't think that that meant 

veterans service organization. I may be wrong. It 

sounds like we have a different understanding.

 But if I can get back on to what is really 

before this Court, is that when there's no indication, 

all we have is the three words "notice of appeal" when 

we know that those three words are non-jurisdictional in 

the criminal context, that there's nothing 

jurisdictional about the word "notice of appeal." It 

accurately describes that an appeal is going on. It 

doesn't say anything about whether the deadline is

jurisdiction.

 And the question is: Was Congress thinking 

about the type of people who appeal district courts to 

courts of appeals? Yes, they were, but they made 

separate provisions for that. Or were they thinking 

about the Hobbs Act, which deals with licensing of 

nuclear power plants and orders by the FCC, and has an 

express statement in the text that it's jurisdictional?

 I doubt that -- I think it is safe to say 

that Congress was not thinking about any of those 

contexts. They were trying to give veterans their day 

in court. And this decision would say no matter what 

the circumstances are, they are deprived.

 Now, there was some discussion on the 

120-day deadline. I think another thing that is very 

safe to say is that time is not of the essence in the 

veterans system. It never has been. One hundred and 

twenty days is a blink of an eye. It's true that Social 

Security are given 60 days and other appellants are 

given 30.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you helped or hurt in 

making that argument when this is not de novo review? 

think you're helped. If it's not de novo review, that 

helps -­

MS. BLATT: Yes, there's no prejudice. They

because it has to be based on the record before, and all 

we're talking about is an extra 30 days or 60 days.
