CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 11-94, Southern Union Company v. The United 

States. 

Mr. Phillips. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

In its landmark decision in Apprendi, this 

Court announced as a fundamental principle of Fifth and 

Sixth Amendment jurisprudence that every fact necessary 

to increase the punishment beyond that which is 

otherwise maximally provided for must be presented to 

the jury and must be decided by the jury beyond a 

reasonable doubt. 

In this particular case, the defendant was 

fined a total of an $18 million penalty in the context 

of a jury finding that there was a single day of 

violation under the RCRA provision. Congress is quite 

explicit that the maximum fine for a single day's 

violation is $50,000. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Was that jury trial 

constitutionally required?

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I believe the jury trial 

was constitutionally required, Justice Scalia. The 

cutoff between what's a petty offense not subject to 

jury trial and what's beyond that -- I think you could 

-- you could get there two ways. This is a crime that 

Congress attaches a 5-year penalty to if it's against an 

individual, which suggests that it is a very serious 

crime. And the maximum fine under the district judge's 

interpretation of this would have been $38 million, even 

though the judge chose only to impose an $18 million 

penalty under these circumstances. So, either way, it 

seems to me clearly a serious offense. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What have we said is the 

standard for fines? 

MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What have we said with 

reference to a jury trial when fines are involved? Does 

it have to be a substantial fine or do we have a word 

that we use? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, you haven't used a word 

-- I mean, the distinction is between a serious offense 

and a petty offense, and the places where the -- you 

know, you've drawn the line to conclude that a fine was 

too small to be worried about was -- was $10,000 in the 

Muniz case. You recognized in Bagwell that 52 million

was way beyond what would be appropriate under those 

circumstances. 

But I think the Court benefits most if it 

just focuses on the potential penalties that Congress 

has adopted and use that as the guidepost, because if 

Congress has said that this is something for which 

someone could be punished --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you have to do that 

because you have to know whether -- whether to impanel a 

jury before the -- before the jury comes in or before 

the jury comes in with a penalty, right? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right, absolutely. And we 

asserted our right to a jury trial. The government 

didn't contest our right to a jury trial. And I don't 

actually read their brief --

JUSTICE ALITO: Do we assume for purposes of 

this case that your client, a corporation, has a Sixth 

Amendment right to a jury trial? 

MR. PHILLIPS: I think the language of the 

Sixth Amendment couldn't be clearer, that it says in all 

criminal prosecutions, the -- the accused is entitled to 

a jury trial, and all -- and you know, Article III, 

section 2, says in all jury trial -- in all criminal 

prosecutions, there's a jury trial. So, there is no 

effort whatsoever to limit the -- the individual, or in

any way to -- the person or persons or entities that are 

entitled to those rights. 

JUSTICE ALITO: What are the peers of the 

Southern Union Company that would sit on the jury? 

Other railroads? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that would have been --

we'd probably have had a different outcome if that had 

been the case. But, no, Your Honor, obviously "peers" 

in that context is -- is derived from the citizenry in 

the State or the district in which the prosecution is 

brought. I mean, obviously, we don't get corporate 

peers in that sense, but -- but no one has ever doubted 

that an ordinary jury would be a suitable jury of peers 

for corporations, and, candidly, corporations are tried 

all of the time, and no one has doubted it. And I don't 

think it -- you know, first of all, it seems clear, 

under the language of the Sixth Amendment and Article 

III, that corporations are entitled to a jury and that 

no one is -- in anything that's a serious offense, and 

that clearly is what we have here. 

And so, what we've got is a decision by the 

jury that there was at a -- at a single point in time a 

violation of RCRA. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not -- the jury 

didn't say that the defendant was in violation only 1

day. It said it was in violation within this span of 

many months, and it didn't say how many days. It didn't 

say whether it was every day or 1 day or 10 days. It 

just didn't focus on the number of days. But it didn't 

find they were in violation only 1 day, which is what 

your opening statement was. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But what the -- what 

the First Circuit said, Justice Ginsburg, is that the --

the most you could read the jury to have found, because 

it was not asked the question, the most you could read 

out of it, was that there was a single day of a 

violation, and that that then sets the maximum. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The most -- the most you 

must read out of it. 

MR. PHILLIPS: The most you must read out of 

it. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. You could -- you 

could say it could have meant -- they could have thought 

that they violated every day. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. They could have. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't say that for 

sure. But one thing you can say for sure is that they 

found that it violated it 1 day. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. That's correct, 

Justice Scalia, and that, therefore, if you apply the

core Apprendi doctrine in a principled way, as 

Justice Kennedy suggested in a separate concurrence, if 

you applied it in a principled way, you determine what 

-- what facts are supported by the jury's findings and 

how far does the penalty take it, and it goes to 

$50,000, and anything beyond the $50,000, if it's found 

by the judge, doesn't satisfy the Sixth or Fifth 

Amendment under those circumstances. 

That should be in my judgment the end of the 

inquiry. The First Circuit rejected that argument by 

turning to Oregon v. Ice and suggesting that there was a 

fundamental shift in how the Court applies the Apprendi 

doctrine. And I -- I would suggest to you that, 

although you're clearly better positioned to determine 

what you thought you meant by Ice than I am, my 

interpretation of Ice is that it deals with the very 

different situation of multiple offenses and the very 

different problem of trying to extend the Apprendi 

doctrine to the context of multiple convictions and then 

adopted a methodology for applying it in those 

circumstances that focus significantly on a particular 

history of consecutive versus concurrent sentences --

JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't think --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- in that context.

be in dissent in these cases; so, I don't have the 

authoritative view. But the --

MR. PHILLIPS: More so than I do, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What? 

MR. PHILLIPS: More so than I do. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but no. But the 

impression I have is that -- that I had thought there 

were what I'd call the elements of the offense, and then 

there were sentencing facts. And sentencing facts have 

been traditionally facts found by the judge when 

imposing a sentence. 

Now, the majority of the Court in Apprendi 

went back into the history and said there is no 

significant old tradition, old enough, of -- of 

sentencing facts. So, really, when you raise the 

sentence, that's like an element, and you should have a 

jury trial. 

Now, the argument here, one of them, that the 

government stresses -- and Ice is the same -- is that 

there is no -- the tradition's different where fines and 

where multiple and concurrent sentences were at issue. 

If you go back to the 18th century or 

earlier, what you'll discover is that the judge has 

always had a much greater role in deciding what the

amount of a fine should be. And, therefore, insofar as 

that amount rested upon some view of the facts as to the 

manner in which the crime occurred -- and it always 

does -- it was the judge who traditionally found it, not 

the jury. So, those facts are not like elements of the 

crime. 

That's what I thought was essentially the 

argument. Ice and fines are on one side of that line, 

and Apprendi is on the other. 

MR. PHILLIPS: I think the -- the problem 

with that analysis, Justice Breyer, is I don't think the 

history, first of all, is anywhere near as clear in this 

context as it was, for instance, in Ice in terms of who 

decided what. It is -- there is no history that 

suggests that judges had the authority to impose fines 

beyond whatever the maximum statutory limit that was 

provided for by the legislature involved. And if you --

and if you go through --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. They're not doing 

that here. What they're deciding is a fact of 

sentencing is how often this crime was committed. No 

one can go against the statutory limit, but rather it --

it allows a higher sentence when certain facts occur. 

Now, I thought in Apprendi that the history 

is just what I'm saying it was in -- in the fine case,

but the majority says to the contrary. And so, here it 

seems, even if I was wrong in Apprendi, that at least 

there's enough discretion here to say, look, this is 

traditionally up to the judge. Now, why do you think 

that isn't so? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Because it never was 

traditionally up to the judge to go beyond whatever the 

maximum sentence provided was. Justice Thomas's 

concurrence in Apprendi spends a significant amount of 

time with that history. He several times references 

jury -- I mean fines and jury determinations and 

consistently finds that the same rule applies in the 

fine context as applies in the -- in the incarceration 

context. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, do you think 

that you could say that there was no going above the 

statutory maximum here? In other words, you know, if 

the judge had said, well, it's $500 a day, I'm going to 

find some facts and fine you $600 a day, that would be 

going above a statutory maximum. 

But I'm wondering whether this is different 

because here the judge was sticking to the $500 a day 

that was set out in the statute, and then the question 

is more, you know, of an -- is it an element or is it a 

-- is it a sentencing fact as to how many days the

violation occurred? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, Justice Kagan, I would 

have thought, if anything, our case would be a much 

easier one, because what you -- what you basically are 

saying is that the district judge on the basis of a 

non-reasonable doubt standard and without a jury is 

making a determination that there have been 761 

violations of Federal law and, on that basis, imposing a 

sentence. 

It would seem to me that, whatever else you 

might want to say Apprendi should limit, it would be the 

whole idea that the judge gets to determine every aspect 

of all elements of the crime and the punishment that 

attaches to it. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there an objection at 

trial to the charge on the ground that it didn't 

instruct the jury to find the number of days of 

violation? 

MR. PHILLIPS: The United States didn't 

object to that. No, Your Honor. Actually, we didn't 

object to it either, and it wasn't an instruction that 

was offered by either of the parties. The judge 

actually was the one who divined the instruction with 

respect to a single --

to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But this was in the 

context where the entire defense of the corporation was 

consistent with what the indictment said. It was 

between the dates on or about, and there -- it would be 

very strange under this evidence to think that it was 

only there for 1 day, when it was spilled and they came 

back. And so, that just doesn't make any sense. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, Justice Kennedy --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think there's -- that's 

just more a sense of background. I do think we have to 

reach the issue you -- you present as if it were just --

as if there were no evidence. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- like Justice 

Ginsburg, I was very surprised the government didn't 

allege -- didn't stress waiver here. You didn't submit 

an instruction? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- yes, we didn't 

submit an instruction. On the other hand, neither side 

submitted the particular instruction that the judge 

adopted in this particular case. But what I think is 

important is to put it in the context of the -- of the 

evidence at trial and the way it was analyzed by the 

First Circuit under the -- on the harmless error

standard. Remember that the issue here is not that they 

simply have mercury in a particular location without a 

permit. The question was, did they -- were they holding 

it with an intent to recycle it at some point and to 

make it a usable product? 

And there were three different points in 

time when evidence clearly demonstrated an intent to 

obtain an RFP to handle the product in precisely that 

way, even up to the summer of 2004, and the indictment 

only runs to October of 2004. 

So, the notion that it could be a -- a 

significantly shorter period, maybe not -- maybe not 

just a day, ultimately, but clearly you can't -- we just 

don't know because no one asked under those 

circumstances. The First Circuit said this could not be 

viewed as harmless error, and I think that's not 

challenged by the United States at this stage in the 

litigation. 

And so, it seems to me, as you say, 

Justice Kennedy, you have to evaluate the pure issue 

of -- you have 1 day of violation, that's the 

determination, and when -- and to take the Apprendi 

doctrine. As it -- as it's stated, it's quite plain. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Phillips, can you

that gives me some pause? And that is, the number of 

days is certainly something that the jury here could --

relatively easily decided upon. It could have looked at 

the evidence and figured that out --

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- okay? But in fraud 

cases, in securities cases, sometimes the identity of 

victims is not determined for months, till months after 

the conviction, and the amount of fine and/or 

restitution is set at sentencing. 

What's going to happen to all of those 

statutes --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because -- or all of 

those procedures that have been set up by Congress to 

sort of set the amount of loss and repayment? Are all 

of those subject to the Apprendi rule? 

MR. PHILLIPS: I dont -- I don't think so. 

I mean, the lower courts have been pretty consistent on 

the question of restitution, that restitution is, one, 

not a punishment within the meaning of Apprendi; and, 

two, it's indeterminate. And as a consequence of that, 

the jury doesn't have to make that determination. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, isn't -- aren't 

fines indeterminate here by definition, going back to

Justice Kagan's question? There's no upper limit to how 

much the fine could be here. It's set -- the upper 

limit is set by the number of days, but why is it 

different? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, because it is set by 

the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why is restitution --

MR. PHILLIPS: Because it is set by the 

number of days --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, so -- so --

finding of how many days. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how about when a 

fine is set by the value of the loss?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's no different than 

restitution. 

MR. PHILLIPS: And the government will have 

to figure out what it -- what it -- its best take as to 

the value of the loss, and it's going to have to prove 

that if that's going to be the basis on which to fine.

that's fundamentally different. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, leave that out 

because we assume -- right. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: It says, the fine, the 

maximum fine is going to be "not more than the greater 

of twice the gross gain or twice the gross loss." 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, you're going to send 

that to the jury. Let me read you the next phase --

phrase: "unless imposition of a fine under this 

subsection would unduly complicate or prolong the 

sentencing process." 

I point to that next phrase to show you that 

Congress understands, in an antitrust case, in a RICO 

case, in a corruption case of different kinds, in an 

environmental case, it is so complicated figuring out 

that kinds of things that they excuse even the judge 

who's experienced in this from dealing with that. And 

under your theory, as you just point out, if Apprendi 

applies here, we're suddenly telling juries to -- they 

have to under the Constitution administer that section 

18 U.S.C. 3571, which I just read to you.

this Court consistently that the jury trial right 

doesn't necessarily make for the most efficient criminal 

proceeding. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I understand you could 

say that's what the Constitution provides, and if you 

jury can't handle it, well, too bad. Okay. But I think 

we're still in the business of trying to decide whether 

the Constitution does provide that in the case of fines. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but I -- I would hope 

that the Court wouldn't -- wouldn't let the tail wag the 

dog in that particular context. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that a tail? Is that a 

tail that the jury proceeding is itself so 

unadministrable that even Congress says we recognize 

even a judge couldn't do it? All right?

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that an irrelevant 

consideration when you are trying to figure out whether 

an ambiguous history requires the jury trial?

part of the history that is unambiguous is the 

importance of the jury as a bulwark against the Federal

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in 1790, in fact in 

the first Judiciary Act and in the Crimes Act of 1790, 

Congress enacted statutes, criminal statutes, that 

authorized a fine and left it entirely to the discretion 

of the court. Were those unconstitutional? 

MR. PHILLIPS: If it -- up to the maximum. 

JUSTICE ALITO: There was no maximum. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, then there -- then it's 

an indeterminate sentence, and, of course, they're not 

unconstitutional. The core of Apprendi --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Congress permitted --

JUSTICE ALITO: And what's -- what --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- in 1790 indeterminate 

sentences as well, with no statutory maximum for jail. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I think that's what 

Justice Scalia -- or Alito was saying. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, they did both --

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- with respect to 

fines and --

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. They had both, but 

the one thing they didn't have is a situation where, 

whatever the statutory maximum was, the judge was 

permitted to go beyond the maximum based on findings 

that the judge offered up on his part without the

JUSTICE ALITO: So, if the judge can -- if 

it's totally up to the discretion of the judge, that's 

fine; but if Congress enacts a statute that structures 

the fine -- and says, if this is the case, then so much; 

if that's the case, then so much more -- then you have 

to have a jury trial? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely. If --

JUSTICE ALITO: What sense does that make? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Because you can take --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that precisely what 

Apprendi said? Is --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that was the easy 

answer. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. PHILLIPS: But, more fundamentally, and 

it's -- and it's demonstrated in a case just like this 

one --

JUSTICE ALITO: That may be what Apprendi 

said, but is it consistent with the original meaning of 

the jury trial right in the Sixth Amendment? These 

statutes give me pause on that score. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, because -- but these 

statutes don't speak to what Apprendi was talking about,

which is a situation where you set a maximum above which 

the judge is permitted to go. None of the statutes that 

are out there exist that demonstrate that. All -- and 

all the language and all of the discussion in Justice 

Thomas's concurrence talks about up to the -- you know, 

you have broad discretion up to the maximum. Once you 

go beyond the maximum, at that point the jury trial 

right has to kick in. 

And let me say it in this context. Here's a 

situation where the government proves up its case in the 

context of a $50,000 fine; and that's what the jury is 

asked to decide, and it decides that; and then the judge 

gets to say: Okay, $38 million is now the right number. 

If that's not the tail wagging the dog within the 

meaning of even the cases that preceded Apprendi, it 

seems to me there's a fundamental flaw in that 

particular scheme. 

The history between fines and incarceration 

are essentially the same. What the Court said in 

Apprendi should be followed exactly under these 

circumstances. Ice should be distinguished on the 

recognition that multiple offenses are fundamentally 

different from a single offense. And on that basis the 

judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.

old case that the Government cites, U.S. v. Tyler? And 

it was the question of -- the penalty was four times the 

value of the goods, and this Court said the judge, not 

the jury, is responsible for imposing the fine and, 

therefore, also for determining the value of the goods. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Tyler is in -- in many 

ways kind of imponderable. The one thing that's clear, 

it's not a Sixth Amendment decision. It wasn't actually 

argued. All it says is that under this law -- and the 

problem, obviously, in this case was they found -- you 

know, it was -- the pounds weren't -- weren't the 

problem. The problem was obviously they had identified 

one substance in the indictment, and the jury found 

another substance in its verdict; and so, there was the 

disconnect there, and the Court basically said we're not 

going to worry about that trifling under these 

circumstances. 

What it doesn't say remotely is that the 

Sixth -- is that -- you know, that the Sixth Amendment 

would permit the judge to make that finding under those 

circumstances. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you were to prevail, I 

-- I think it would be a rather simple matter for the 

parties to frame an instruction: We find the defendant 

guilty and that the pollutant was retained for X days,

much of what they do in a drug case. That's one way to 

do it. Could the government do it by the indictment? 

Could it indict alternatively, indict on count 1 for 10 

days, count 2 for 50 days, or something like that? 

MR. PHILLIPS: They could do it that way 

or --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Maybe -- is that the way 

it often works or --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I would have thought 

actually the indictment in this case was probably 

adequate for these purposes because it said: During the 

entirety of the period from September 2002 to 

October 2004. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's why I am 

surprised the government waived it, and I thought that's 

what the evidence showed anyway. But that's not before 

us. That's not the way the case is presented here. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right, Your Honor. That's 

correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: How, in general -- I mean, 

in the individual case, very often a trial doesn't come 

up because 90 percent or more of the time it's just a 

question of a plea bargain; and, therefore, the 

defendant doesn't -- this is an added weapon for him, 

Apprendi. But in your -- with your clients and the others,

So, how in a trial does your client or 

others in that position defend on the ground of we 

didn't do this at all; but by the way, in case you 

decide to the contrary, jury, we want to tell you we 

only did it Monday, Wednesday, and Friday? 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: How is that supposed to 

work? Do you have two juries? 

MR. PHILLIPS: No. Well, I mean, look, if 

we think we're going to be prejudiced as a consequence 

of trying this in a particular way, it will be our call 

whether or not to waive the jury trial right under those 

circumstances. But, more fundamentally, at least in 

this particular case, obviously our position was we 

didn't form the intent at any point in time and -- but, 

you know, if ultimately the -- the jury had found that 

there was some other point in time, then, you know, 

we'll deal with that issue as we deal with it. 

But it wouldn't have been -- I don't think 

the trial in this case would have been significantly 

different. The only thing that would have been 

different is that the jury would have been properly 

instructed and our jury trial right would have been 

preserved. As it is here, our jury trial right has been

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

This case, like Oregon v. Ice, involves the 

kind of finding that the common law never entrusted to 

the jury. There is, therefore, no erosion or 

encroachment on the jury function by assigning the 

function of determining the days of violation to the 

court for the purpose of determining the criminal fine. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree, don't 

you, that the statement in Oregon v. Ice was pure dicta? 

MR. DREEBEN: The Court's statement in Ice 

-- that if a purely algebraic application of Apprendi 

were followed, it would sweep in things such as fines 

and restitution -- was not necessary to the judgment, 

Mr. Chief Justice, but it was part of the Court's 

rationale in adopting a different take on the meaning of 

the Apprendi line of cases than had previously been

espoused. Up until --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, I think the 

reference -- it was a fleeting reference to fines, and 

it could have meant that the judge has discretion to set 

the fine up to the maximum in the statute. That's one 

possible meaning. 

MR. DREEBEN: That is true, Justice 

Ginsburg. But I think that the author of the opinion in 

Ice was citing to an amicus brief filed by States, which 

supplied illustrations of fine statutes that it believed 

would be imperiled by a purely programmatic rule-based 

application of Apprendi. 

And two of the State statutes that were 

cited in that amicus brief, that of New Jersey and 

Alaska, involved the kind of gain or loss statute that 

has been discussed this morning, in which the judge, 

following the rendition of a guilty verdict, determined 

the amount of gain or loss and then applied either a 

double or triple amount as the maximum fine. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: This was -- you're not 

arguing that this rule will apply only to fines against 

corporations? It would also apply to individuals, 

right? 

MR. DREEBEN: Correct, Justice Scalia.

decide how many days or what the value was and so forth. 

Right? 

MR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, the right to trial by 

jury to have that very important fact found does not 

exist, even for individuals? 

MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, the tradition 

with respect to monetary fines is different than the 

tradition that the Court analyzed in Apprendi. With 

respect to fines, restitution, and forfeiture, the jury 

was never given a substantive role at common law. And 

the law today is with respect to forfeiture --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure how you can 

fully make that argument, because I thought the history 

was set forth fairly clearly in Apprendi that the early 

history was that nothing was given to the jury with 

respect to imprisonment or fines because most if not all 

sentences were indeterminate. It's only when States 

began, and the Federal government, to experiment with 

determinate sentences that the Apprendi issue then 

became live. 

MR. DREEBEN: Justice Sotomayor, I think 

what Apprendi relied on primarily was the linkage 

between charge and penalty in English law, which was, 

for felonies, death. The Court distinguished in a

footnote the tradition with respect to misdemeanors, 

which it acknowledged was judicial discretion with 

respect to fines and whippings, and it did not rely on 

that history in fashioning the Apprendi rule. 

What it relied on were two things: First, 

the traditional linkage between charge and authorized 

penalty in English common law; and, second, the 

tradition in America that when the legislature had put a 

cap on the amount of the penalty, the judge had 

discretion within it not to go above it. 

But neither of those aspects of Apprendi 

addressed the issue that's before the Court today, which 

is whether it would be an expansion beyond the domain 

that was covered in Apprendi to apply it to monetary 

penalties in --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, explain to me, other 

than your reliance on Ice, some sort of tradition, 

which, you know, we can debate whether you can draw any 

conclusion from tradition in any of these areas, whether 

it's imprisonment or fines. 

Tell me on the logic of Apprendi, not using 

Ice, why fines are different, without relying on 

history, which to me is -- I view it as ambiguous. 

Okay? 

MR. DREEBEN: It's difficult to do that,

Justice Sotomayor, because the Court fashioned the 

Apprendi rule from history, and it limited it based on 

history in Ice. It doesn't operate as an algorithm that 

simply applies automatic --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought it was a fairly 

simple algorithm. It says if the statutory penalty --

if a judge's factfinding can increase the statutory 

penalty, then that's a violation of the Sixth Amendment. 

A jury has to find any fact that increases the statutory 

maximum. 

MR. DREEBEN: Yes, and that -- that was the 

argument of the Ice dissenters, that Apprendi states a 

rule that knows no exceptions for history or the impact 

on the States. And Ice does represent I think a --

shows where the high-water mark of Apprendi was. The 

high-water mark was with respect to the penalty of 

imprisonment. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, outside of a -- a --

imprisonment, there is no other penalty that Congress 

could fashion because it has no history that wouldn't be 

within the purview of the judge? 

MR. DREEBEN: Well, of course, the death 

penalty in Ring v. Arizona. The Court held that facts 

that expose a defendant to the death penalty must be 

found by the jury. So, the Court has extended Apprendi

to those core liberty areas. But even with respect to 

the implications for the length of imprisonment, the 

quantum of punishment that a defendant faces when he's 

convicted of multiple offenses, this Court in Ice looked 

to history and the impact on the administration of 

justice before being willing to extend Apprendi outside 

of its core domain. And I think it's highly relevant --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Dreeben, wasn't the 

core domain defined by whether it related to a specific 

statutory offense? So, Ice says the core concern is "a 

legislative attempt to remove from the province of the 

jury the determination of facts that warrant a 

punishment for a specific statutory offense." How is 

that not relevant precisely in this context? 

MR. DREEBEN: Well, it is, of course, 

relevant, Justice Kagan, but --

JUSTICE KAGAN: How does it not determine 

this context? I mean, those --

MR. DREEBEN: Because the Court went on 

several paragraphs later in its opinion to describe what 

it would mean to adopt a formulaic application of 

Apprendi, treating it just as a rule divorced from 

history. And one of the consequences that the Court 

considered was the impact it would have on sentencing 

accoutrements, two of which are directly related to this

case because they are financial penalties, fines and 

restitution. 

Now, I've talked about how the amicus brief 

that prompted that paragraph, the concern about the 

implications of expanding Apprendi, referred to fine 

statutes that operate on a gain or loss basis, which 

necessarily requires judicial factfinding after the 

guilty verdict comes in. 

But if the Court isn't satisfied with those, 

restitution which is explicitly mentioned in Apprendi --

excuse me -- in Ice, classically operates based on 

findings about victim loss that occur after the guilty 

verdict has come in. This Court is well familiar that 

oftentimes courts have to postpone sentencing in order 

to allow the victim to gather evidence and to present 

it. 

Now, the Court could, I suppose, do as the 

lower courts have done and say restitution is different 

because it's designed simply to compensate for loss; 

and, therefore, it's in one sense remedial. But that 

will have to deal with the fact that in cases like 

Pasquantino v. United States and Pennsylvania v. 

Davenport, the Court has described restitution as a 

criminal penalty. 

Now, the other way in which lower courts

have said that restitution isn't swept up by Apprendi is 

to say it's a rule that has no maximum. Whatever the 

amount of harm to the victim is, that can be compensated 

through restitution. 

But, again, if one is applying an algebraic 

understanding of the relevant statutory maximum from the 

Blakely decision, restitution would be hard to justify 

because the jury verdict does not contain findings about 

harm to victims. The jury verdict finds guilt. 

Afterwards, the judge finds an additional fact, namely 

the amount of harm, and imposes restitution. And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of odd, 

though, isn't it? I mean, to some extent, this is a 

little easier case for you, because it does involve a 

corporation. But there are statutes where the amount of 

imprisonment and the amount of a fine can both increase 

based on a particular fact. 

MR. DREEBEN: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And under your 

submission, if you have -- you know, say a defendant who 

is subject to 1 year, and that if a particular fact is 

found, he's subject to 2 years, a fine of 20 but then 

40, the judge would be constitutionally prohibited from 

increasing the prison sentence but would be perfectly 

free to increase the fine --

MR. DREEBEN: Probably --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- including in a 

situation where the fine might be a lot more serious 

than the -- the time in prison. 

MR. DREEBEN: Well, probably, 

Mr. Chief Justice, such a statute would be construed to 

make that fact one for the jury, since it dictates 

imprisonment increases as well as fine increases. And 

so, the constitutional question is unlikely to arise. 

Congress would have been deemed to have intended that 

that kind of a fact go to the jury. 

That's not what -- the case in this statute. 

This statute provides a 5-year maximum penalty, and then 

it provides a fine amount that's graduated to the days 

of the violation. The violation in this case was one 

single violation. The judge did not find that there 

were multiple violations; the judge simply looked at the 

record, and his task is to decide how long did that 

violation --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure, he operated --

he operated in a reasonable way. But we give juries the 

discretion to be unreasonable. It would not -- juries 

often compromise. So, if the instructions and the 

verdict told the jury you can find the defendant, you 

know, guilty for 1 day or whatever it is -- the 30

million; 50,000 or 30 million -- it would not be at all 

unusual for the jury to debate and say, well, let's find 

him guilty for 10 million. 

MR. DREEBEN: We do presume --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And return that 

verdict. The judge is constrained by reason in a way 

that the jury is not, and that's sort of -- that's part 

of the protection the Sixth Amendment provided. 

MR. DREEBEN: This Court has never 

recognized jury nullification as a constitutionally 

protected right. We presume a rational jury. We 

presume that if the jury is confronted with the evidence 

and the law as given to it by the court, it will apply 

that law in a rational manner. And the question here is 

whether that is something that the jury is 

constitutionally entitled to do. 

Now, coming back to the historical 

foundations of the Apprendi rule and the extension 

that's requested here, with all due respect to 

Petitioner, I think United States v. Tyler is much more 

significant than Petitioner gives it credit for. 

This is a case decided in 1812 on a Court 

that had on it Chief Justice Marshall and Justice Story.

traditions and well familiar with how judges would find

facts at the time of the founding. And in Tyler, there 

was a charge that the defendant had unlawfully exported, 

in violation of an embargo law, an amount of pearl ashes 

that were worth $600. And the jury came back with a 

verdict that said we find that the defendant unlawfully 

exported pot ashes worth $280. And the question is: 

Could a verdict be imposed on this, and could the judge 

set the fine? 

The two judges on the circuit court 

disagreed, and so it was certified to the Supreme Court. 

And this Court held unanimously that finding a valuation 

was a judge function, not a jury function. No valuation 

was necessary in order for the court to impose the 

proper fine. 

And it's difficult to understand how this 

Court could have said that, if there were such a 

well-settled constitutionally protected entitlement to a 

jury verdict on facts that dictated a fine, if indeed 

this statute assigned the role to the judge and the 

Court was fully comfortable with that role being carried 

out. 

And Tyler is a decision of this Court. 

There is no decision of this Court with respect to 

imprisonment that is anything like Tyler. The 

traditions with respect to imprisonment would surely be

understood in a different manner than with respect to 

fines. And when one looks at fines, restitution, and 

forfeiture as a package of possible financial penalties 

and asks the question, did the Framers envision that 

these matters would be within the jury's domain as 

opposed to the judge's in imposing the appropriate 

sentence after a jury verdict, I think that the answer 

is they would not have viewed it as a matter protected 

by the Sixth Amendment, because there was no factual 

predicate in the common Law that would have led them to 

believe the jury's function would be eroded if those 

matters were not. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A very -- very 

simple matter for the government to ask for jury 

findings on the questions at issue in this case, right? 

MR. DREEBEN: We could have done it here, 

Mr. Chief Justice. The broader concern is cases that 

involve gain or loss, in which the question of how much 

loss may have been suffered by hundreds or even 

thousands of victims of fraud is typically not 

undertaken -- the process of quantifying them isn't done 

until the guilty verdict is in because it's an 

enormously difficult and complicated task. As 

Justice Breyer pointed out, the judge isn't even 

required to do it at sentencing if it proves to be too

complicated. 

And for jury trials to do it, there may well 

be a need for bifurcation. And this Court in 

Oregon v. Ice declined to impose on the States the need 

to bifurcate trials to determine whether a sentence 

should be run consecutively or concurrently, because 

that would intrude upon a valuable reform that was 

designed to provide some restraints on judicial 

discretion. 

The same kind of thing would operate here if 

this Court adopts an across-the-board rule that fines 

have to be proved to a jury. If it extended it to 

restitution and to forfeiture, that would involve 

overruling the Court's decision in Libretti v. United 

States, which held that forfeiture is a sentencing 

function. But upon a strict application of Apprendi, a 

mathematically, geometrically accurate application of 

the rule stated in Apprendi, it's difficult to see why 

forfeiture is not something that has to be --

Story --

Story was on Tyler. He wrote -- he sat on circuit in a

JUSTICE SCALIA: Quite so. 

MR. DREEBEN: And this is in our brief. And 

he -- he interpreted Tyler and said the court would not 

have given the direction that it did, that a judgment 

could be entered based on the fine amount, unless they 

were satisfied that an indictment lay and that the fine 

was to be imposed by the court and not found by the jury 

as a penalty. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The jury did find it in 

Tyler, though, didn't it? The question was submitted to 

the jury, wasn't it? 

MR. DREEBEN: The jury --

discussing right now is to be regarded as surplusage. 

In other words, this -- Tyler explains that although it 

was submitted to the jury, it wasn't necessary to be 

submitted to the jury. The charge had asked for $600 of 

value which would then be subject to the fine. The jury 

found only $280. 

And as I interpret the Court's decision and 

I think as Justice Story interpreted it sitting on 

circuit in Mann, it said this isn't a jury function. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did it -- as a matter of 

statutory construction, right? 

MR. DREEBEN: Well, the -- again, I would 

readily concede, Justice Scalia, that the Sixth 

Amendment does not appear --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

Tyler, but it's difficult for me to understand that a 

Court that included Chief Justice Marshall, Justice 

Story, and other members who were well familiar with how 

common law operated would have adopted an interpretation 

of a statute that was facially unconstitutional.

doctrine. I simply submit it as evidence that this

My submission is that they wouldn't have

the kind of thing that had to go to a jury.

least?

back and look at the opinion to tell you whether it was 

an argued case. There's no citation of any 

constitutional law in -- in that decision. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What makes acceptable 

common law? Let's assume there weren't 50 States back 

then, but whatever the number was, 20 States, and 15 of 

them submitted it to the jury and 5 didn't. Does that 

mean there was no common law that this was generally 

submitted to the jury? If you can point to one case, 

that's enough to defeat the existence of a common law 

view? 

MR. DREEBEN: I doubt that I would say that, 

Justice Sotomayor. The -- the jurisprudence of the 

former colonies/new States is not uniform. I -- the --

there is something I think of mythology in speaking 

about the common law as one indivisible body of law.

is one fact that truly stands out about fines, and that 

is they were historically at common law products of 

judicial discretion. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But so was imprisonment.

Imprisonment was hardly ever imposed in the early 

colonies and in England, because --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, how many statutes 

had anything but indeterminate fine structures?

Pennsylvania, the law of Massachusetts, the law of New 

York. It's all varied and complicated, but there were a 

few of them there. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: If it's varied and 

complicated, why should we -- assuming that it's 

ambiguous, why should we adopt the strange rule that the 

jury has to find the fact if you go to jail for 2 weeks, 

but doesn't have to find the fact if the amount of fines

assigned the role of finding fines to juries. There may 

be an example or two that one could find if you dig 

through the mass of colonial records, but the dominant 

trend, and it was acknowledged by Blackstone, was that 

the common law never assigned the responsibility of 

fines to the jury, and statutes did so rarely.

because the resources required to imprison just didn't 

exist, and imprisonment really is a product that

then there is an -- an arson case called Ritchey from 

Indiana in which the court did seem to think that in 

order to sustain a proper prosecution where the fine 

amount varied based on the destruction of the property, 

the jury had to find the amount of the property 

valuation. 

But this is 1845. It's not something that 

would have been present to the mind of the Framers. It 

doesn't indicate clearly what the source of law is, 

whether it's a common law tradition, whether it's 

following something like Smith. Smith itself I think is 

also best understood as a larceny case, and there was 

more of an established tradition that in larceny cases,

the value of the property taken was relevant to the 

jury's findings because it made the difference between a 

capital offense -- a capital offense that could be given 

with benefit of clergy, which was basically a way for 

the English judges to mitigate a death-eligible crime to 

a non-death penalty, or petty larceny, which was 

punished by fines and whipping. So, it graded the 

offense in a way that, for example, the fine penalty at 

issue in this case does not. 

Petitioner is guilty of a felony by virtue 

of the jury verdict. That imposes the stigma of being a 

felon on Petitioner. The judge's role is then to decide 

what was charged in the indictment and what was the 

length of that violation, not to find Petitioner guilty 

of numerous additional violations. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What if the judge disagreed 

with the jury about whether there was even a violation? 

MR. DREEBEN: The jury's acquittal would end 

the criminal case. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, no. The jury 

finds a violation, but the judge thinks the jury got it 

wrong. 

MR. DREEBEN: Well, in that case --

that the evidence is insufficient under Jackson v. 

Virginia, he's bound by the jury. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, he finds, you know, 

they could have come out that way, but -- but they were 

wrong. 

MR. DREEBEN: Then I think that he would be 

bound by the day of violation, $50,000 limit, subject to 

another provision of Federal law, 3573(c), which 

provides in the case of an organization that a felony 

exposes the defendant to a $500,000 fine. So, there --

there would be other limits applicable in Federal law 

that would explain what the judge is supposed to do in 

that situation. 

The judge, of course, is operating in a 

different way than the jury. The jury is finding guilt 

beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge is applying a 

preponderance of the evidence standard. This Court in 

United States v. Watts has recognized that judges can 

find facts that the jury may have rejected under the 

higher standard.

the reform aimed to structure the discretion of a court 

which at the Founding era might have been impose 

whatever fine you like with no limits whatsoever, except 

the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment --

Congress has come along, as have the State legislatures, 

and sought to structure the deliberations with respect 

to financial penalties. 

Fines, restitution, and forfeiture are now 

structured in a way that basically sends the decision to 

the judge or lowers the standard of proof to a 

preponderance in the case of forfeiture amounts that --

constraints of the Apprendi rule. 

And that distinction between financial 

penalties and infringements on life or liberty is 

consistent with a Sixth Amendment theme. Deprivations 

of life or liberty attract a greater degree of 

protection than fine amounts or other financial 

penalties. There is substantive constitutional 

protection in the Eighth Amendment --

JUSTICE KAGAN: What other rules do you 

think are different? I mean, is there a jury trial in 

the one case but not in the other? Is there a right to 

counsel in the one case but not in the other? What else 

turns on this fine/incarceration distinction? 

MR. DREEBEN: In the right to counsel area, 

the Court has held that for misdemeanors, if the 

defendant goes to prison, he's entitled to counsel; if 

the defendant does not, he is not entitled to counsel. 

With respect to jury trials, a petty offense which is 

generally one punishable by less than 6 months in 

prison, there is no jury trial right. A penalty of 

greater than 6 months in prison indicates a more serious 

offense. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What if you call it a 

misdemeanor but -- but impose a very heavy fine? It's 

still a misdemeanor?

serious criminal implication than financial penalties.

you that there's no overlap between property and 

liberty, so that no matter how much of your property are 

taken and what circumstances, it's just property; 

there's no liberty involved? 

MR. DREEBEN: There is, of course, an 

important constitutional value in deprivations of 

property. It's protected by due process, and the 

Excessive Fines Clause explicitly addresses the 

possibility that the judge may impose an unjustified 

penalty. There are also nonconstitutional sources of 

protection such as reasonableness review, which 

Petitioner got in this case, and the First Circuit

and may it please the Court: 

Hopefully, I'll be able to give you back a 

couple of those minutes. 

I'd like to -- I'd like to start with what 

seems to me ultimately the fundamental notion of the 

United States' position, which is that there is a vast 

gulf somehow between fines and imprisonment. And it 

seems to me very difficult within the constitutional 

structure to embrace that approach when, obviously, 

property interests are protected in the Fifth Amendment; 

they're protected in the Eighth Amendment. And if you 

go back to Blackstone, where he talks about inflicting 

corporal punishment or a stated imprisonment of a term, 

which is better than an excessive fine, for that amounts 

to imprisonment for life, there's the recognition 

historically that fines have an enormous impact on 

individuals and, of course, are entitled to fundamental 

constitutional protections. It seems to me that the 

Government's approach there to saying fines are off the 

table and it's completely open season on defendants 

under those circumstances is unjustifiable. 

With respect to restitution, I already 

suggested to the Court all lower courts have concluded 

that restitution is not within the Apprendi doctrine. I

don't think that's going to be a problem under these 

circumstances. 

And -- and I don't think ultimately that the 

issue in this case is sort of what is or is not the 

common law tradition. Because I -- if I go back and I 

think -- I read Justice Thomas's concurrence and the 

history there, he doesn't even mention Tyler as part 

of -- as part of that analysis and, yet, concludes with 

what I think is a very powerful assessment, that juries 

would be available for fines up to, you know, within --

if it were going to go beyond some kind of a maximum. 

But within the maximum, obviously in that context, the 

judge would have complete discretion on -- on how to 

approach it. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the amount of 

loss issue that Justice Breyer raised, was very 

complicated to determine what the amount of the loss is? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 

Justice Ginsburg, I think it's worth 

considering two facts in this case in dealing with what 

I think is purely a policy argument that shouldn't 

override the Constitution. But the first one is that --

the notion that Apprendi applies to fines has been well 

accepted in 99 percent of the country for more than a 

decade. And the Antitrust Division operates and makes

The amicus brief that was filed by the 

Chamber of Commerce demonstrates categorically they --

this -- this gets done every day, and it gets done 

effectively. So, whatever the problem of Apprendi, it 

has not surfaced. And -- and you'll look in the

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If -- on the question of 

the value of goods or the amount of the loss, what would 

the standard be? Would the jury have to find beyond a 

reasonable doubt that it was -- that the value was such 

and such? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I think that's precisely 

what the jury would be asked to find. And juries are 

asked to find that all the time, and they make that kind 

of a determination. 

And I guess the last point that I think as a 

practical matter that ought -- the Court ought to take

notice of is that no State filed an amicus brief in this 

case, that Apprendi has not been the problem in the 

fines context that would even warrant anybody to come in 

here and complain about it. 

It seems to me the right answer is to apply 

the core doctrine, the core principle of Apprendi, which 

even the Government concedes, if you just take the 

language, it talks about any fact that increases the 

penalty, that algorithm takes you to the conclusion the 

judgment below should be reversed. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I may have just 

forgotten, but does your brief go through the status of 

what lower courts have decided with respect to fines and 

how they're dealing with them? I just don't remember it 

as being part of your brief, the statement you just 

made to Justice Kennedy. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, we do -- I mean, we do 

make the -- we demonstrated two things: one, that the 

lower courts pretty consistently have rejected the First 

Circuit's approach --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay. 

MR. PHILLIPS: -- and then, two, that the --

in the amicus brief then focused more in terms of fines 

being used on a regular basis in that period of time in 

those jurisdictions.
